Hi, I'm **ZHalio**. This blog is both my writing space and a lightweight portfolio so hiring managers and collaborators can get a quick, practical view of my work:

- Stack: **Next.js / React / TypeScript / Tailwind / Supabase** with a focus on engineering quality, performance, and maintainability.
- Writing: Architecture choices, frontend/backend practice, perf tuning, observability, and real-world postmortems.
- Portfolio: Curated project cases and runnable demos to show how I build, ship, and keep code healthy.
- Open sharing: I like turning repeatable patterns into reusable tools and best practices to improve team DX.

If you're reviewing my resume, feel free to explore the posts and demos here. Happy to chat more—thanks for stopping by!
