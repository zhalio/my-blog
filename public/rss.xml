鸠摩罗什 (Kumarajiva) —— 后秦时期真谛 (Paramartha) —— 南朝梁/陈时期玄奘 (Xuanzang) —— 唐代

2. 玄奘对我国翻译事业有些什么贡献？
玄奘的贡献是巨大的，主要体现在以下几个方面：

数量与质量双高：他在十九年间译出佛经75部，共1335卷。其译文质量极高，在组织制度方面比过去更健全。文化交流（双向翻译）：他不仅把大量梵文佛经译成汉文，还把老子的著作（《道德经》）的一部分译成梵文，是第一个把汉文著作向国外介绍的中国人。翻译理论：他提出了著名的翻译标准 “既须求真，又须喻俗”。
解释：“求真”即忠实于原文，“喻俗”即译文要通顺通俗，让百姓能懂。这也就是后世所说的“忠实、通顺”。建立了完备的译场：玄奘主持的译场分工明确，程序严谨，标志着中国古代翻译事业的高度成熟。

3. 如何理解严复的“信、达、雅”翻译标准？
严复在《天演论》卷首的《译例言》中提出了“译事三难：信、达、雅”。

原始含义：
信 (Faithfulness)：意义不倍（背）本文，即忠实于原文的内容和意义。达 (Expressiveness)：不拘泥于原文形式，尽译文语言的能事以求原意明显，即通顺流畅。雅 (Elegance)：（这是争议点）严复当时主张的“雅”是指脱离原文而片面追求译文本身的“古雅”，即使用“汉以前字法句法”（上等的文言文）。原文评价与现代理解：
原文指出：严复对“雅”的解释（追求古文言）在今天看来是不足取的，因为这会导致译文艰深难懂，甚至不忠实于原文（类似改编）。补充理解：现代翻译界虽然仍沿用这三个字，但赋予了新的内容。现在的“雅”不再指用古文，而是指 “保存原作的风格”（Style），即译文要有文采，符合目标语的审美规范。

4. “五四”时期翻译工作的特点是什么？
“五四”是我国近代翻译史的分水岭，其主要特点包括：

内容上的转变：从翻译资产阶级学术名著，转向介绍马列主义经典著作和无产阶级文学作品（如《共产党宣言》的翻译）。形式上的变革：白话文代替了文言文。这是最显著的表现，使翻译作品更加普及，更有利于思想的传播。文化影响：东西方各国优秀文学作品（特别是俄国和苏联作品）被大量介绍进来，鲁迅、瞿秋白等是这一时期的卓越先驱。

5. 鲁迅、瞿秋白对翻译工作提出了有些什么看法？
鲁迅和瞿秋白极其重视翻译，主要观点如下：

鲁迅的“宁信而不顺”：
鲁迅针对当时胡乱翻译（“胡译”、“乱译”）和为了通顺而随意篡改原文的现象，提出了 “宁信而不顺” 的原则。注意：这不是说不要通顺，而是在“信”与“顺”不可兼得时，宁可保留原文的语法结构和异国情调（洋气），以输入新的表达方式来丰富汉语，也不要为了讨好读者的阅读习惯而牺牲原文的真实性。兼顾两面：鲁迅认为翻译必须兼顾两面：一当然力求其易解，一则保存着原作的丰姿。反对“硬译”与“死译”：虽然鲁迅主张直译，但他和瞿秋白都反对把直译变成让人看不懂的“死译”，他们主张的是在保持原作风貌基础上的直译。

6. 新中国成立后的翻译工作有哪些特点？
1949年新中国成立后，翻译工作进入了新阶段：

有组织、有计划：改变了过去抢译、乱译和重复浪费的现象，翻译工作在党的领导下系统进行。质量提高：逐渐克服了粗枝大叶、不负责任的现象，译文质量大大提高。服务目的明确：翻译工作更好地为社会主义建设服务。任务双向化：翻译工作者不仅肩负着“外译汉”（介绍外国科技、文化）的任务，还肩负了 “汉译外” 的任务（介绍我国社会主义革命经验和优秀文化遗产）。标准趋向统一：对翻译标准的认识日趋统一，有效地推动了翻译工作。

7. 为什么翻译工作者需要知道一些我国翻译史？

总结经验，批判吸收：约两千年的翻译历史积累了一份宝贵的文化遗产。我们需要认真总结前人的翻译经验，批判地吸收前人从实践中总结出来的理论、方法。继往开来：只有了解历史，才能继承优良传统，继续提高我们的翻译水平，发展翻译事业。简言之，就是“以史为鉴，指导实践”。

8. 当前我国翻译事业有哪些问题值得思考？

量与质的矛盾：随着翻译事业繁荣，客观上翻译需求成倍增长，但合格的翻译人才供不应求。水平参差不齐：翻译水平差距较大，市场上出现了一些质量低劣的翻译作品。人才培养迫切：翻译人才的培养亟待加强，以解决供需矛盾和质量问题。

            <description><![CDATA[数据结构学习笔记-树与二叉树]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[树

树是一个或多个节点的有限集合，其中有一个特殊的节点称为根节点，其他节点可以分为若干个互不相交的子集，每个子集本身又是一个树，称为子树。
示意图如下：

        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \   \
    D   E   F


在这个示意图中，A 是根节点，B 和 C 是 A 的子节点，D 和 E 是 B 的子节点，F 是 C 的子节点。

结点：树中的每一个元素称为结点（Node）。结点的度：一个结点的度是指该结点的子结点的个数。树的度：树的度是指树中所有结点的度的最大值。叶子：叶子结点是指没有子结点的结点。度为0的结点称为叶子结点。非终端结点：非终端结点是指至少有一个子结点的结点。度大于0的结点称为非终端结点。双亲和孩子：在树中，直接连接到某个结点的上一级结点称为该结点的双亲（Parent），而直接连接到某个结点的下一级结点称为该结点的孩子（Child）。兄弟：具有相同双亲的结点互为兄弟（Sibling）。层次：树中结点所在的层次称为该结点的层次（Level）。根节点所在的层次为0，其子节点所在的层次为1，依此类推。高度：树的高度是指树中结点的最大层次。森林：森林是由多棵互不相交的树组成的集合。

树的基本性质

性质一：树中所有结点数等于所有结点的度数之和加1。
性质二：对于度为m的树，第i层最多有$ m^(i-1) $个结点（i≥1）。
性质三：对于度为m且高度为h的树，最多有$ \frac{m^h-1}{m-1} $个结点（m>1）。

二叉树

二叉树是每个结点最多有两个子结点的树。二叉树的每个结点最多有两个孩子，分别称为左孩子和右孩子。
示意图如下：

        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \   \
    D   E   F


在这个示意图中，A 是根节点，B 和 C 是 A 的左孩子和右孩子，D 和 E 是 B 的左孩子和右孩子，F 是 C 的右孩子。

二叉树的基本性质

性质一：二叉树的第i层最多有$ 2^(i-1) $个结点（i≥1）。
性质二：深度为k的二叉树最多有$ 2^k - 1 $个结点（k≥1）。
性质三：对于任意一棵二叉树，设叶子结点数为n0，度为2的结点数为n2，则有：$ n0 = n2 + 1 $。
性质四：具有n个结点的完全二叉树的高度为$ \lfloor log_2 n \rfloor + 1 $。

特殊二叉树--满二叉树与完全二叉树

满二叉树是指每个结点要么是叶子结点，要么有两个子结点的二叉树。完全二叉树是指除最后一层外，每一层的结点数都达到最大，并且最后一层的结点都集中在左侧的二叉树。
示意图如下：

满二叉树：
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \ / \
    D  E F  G


完全二叉树：
(没有左子树，不能有右子树，上一层没铺满，不能有下一层)
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \  /
    D  E F


二叉树的存储结构

顺序存储

顺序存储是将二叉树的结点按层次顺序存储在一维数组中。对于一个结点在数组中的下标为i，则其左孩子的下标为2i+1，右孩子的下标为2i+2，父节点的下标为$ \lfloor (i-1)/2 \rfloor $。

链式存储

链式存储是为每个结点创建一个结构体，包含结点的数据域和两个指针域，分别指向左孩子和右孩子。

typedef struct BiTNode {
    int data; // 数据域
    struct BiTNode *lchild; // 指向左孩子的指针
    struct BiTNode *rchild; // 指向右孩子的指针
} BiTNode, *BiTree;


二叉树的遍历

二叉树的遍历是指按照一定的顺序访问二叉树中的每个结点。常见的遍历方式有三种：前序遍历、中序遍历和后序遍历。

前序遍历：先访问根结点，然后遍历左子树，最后遍历右子树。中序遍历：先遍历左子树，然后访问根结点，最后遍历右子树。后序遍历：先遍历左子树，然后遍历右子树，最后访问根结点。

void PreOrder(BiTree T) {// 前序遍历
    if (T != NULL) {// 判断结点是否为空
        printf("%d ", T->data); // 访问根结点
        PreOrder(T->lchild); // 遍历左子树
        PreOrder(T->rchild); // 遍历右子树
    }
}
void InOrder(BiTree T) {// 中序遍历
    if (T != NULL) {
        InOrder(T->lchild); // 遍历左子树
        printf("%d ", T->data); // 访问根结点
        InOrder(T->rchild); // 遍历右子树
    }
}
void PostOrder(BiTree T) {// 后序遍历
    if (T != NULL) {
        PostOrder(T->lchild); // 遍历左子树
        PostOrder(T->rchild); // 遍历右子树
        printf("%d ", T->data); // 访问根结点
    }
}


线索二叉树

线索二叉树是一种特殊的二叉树，其中的空指针被用来指向结点的前驱或后继结点，从而方便遍历操作。线索二叉树分为前序线索二叉树、中序线索二叉树和后序线索二叉树。

typedef struct ThreadNode {
    int data; // 数据域
    struct ThreadNode *lchild; // 指向左孩子的指针
    struct ThreadNode *rchild; // 指向右孩子的指针
    int ltag; // 左标志，0表示指向孩子，1表示指向前驱
    int rtag; // 右标志，0表示指向孩子，1表示指向后继
} ThreadNode, *ThreadTree;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[栈

栈(stack)是限定仅在表尾进行插入和删除操作的线性表，表尾端称为栈顶，表头端称为栈底。不含元素的空表称为空栈，栈遵循“后进先出”(LIFO, Last In First Out)的原则。
栈的基本操作包括入栈(push)、出栈(pop)和获取栈顶元素(peek)。
示意图：

|     |
进栈  |  C  |  <-- 栈顶 (Top)
 |    |-----|
 v    |  B  |
      |-----|
出栈  |  A  |  <-- 栈底 (Bottom)
 ^    +-----+
 |


栈的顺序结构-初始化

#define MAXSIZE 100
typedef struct {
    int data[MAXSIZE]; // 存储栈元素的数组
    int top;           // 栈顶指针
} SqStack;
// 初始化栈
void InitStack(SqStack *S) {
    S->top = -1; // 栈顶指针初始化为-1，表示栈为空
}


栈的链式结构-初始化

typedef struct StackNode {
    int data;                 // 栈元素
    struct StackNode *next;   // 指向下一个节点的指针
} StackNode;
typedef struct {
    StackNode *top; // 栈顶指针
} LinkStack;
// 初始化栈
void InitStack(LinkStack *S) {
    S->top = NULL; // 栈顶指针初始化为NULL，表示栈为空
}


栈的基本操作

入栈(push)

// 顺序栈入栈
int Push(SqStack *S, int e) {
    if (S->top == MAXSIZE - 1) return 0; // 栈满，无法入栈
    S->data[++(S->top)] = e; // 元素入栈
    return 1; // 入栈成功
}
// 链式栈入栈
int Push(LinkStack *S, int e) {
    StackNode *newNode = (StackNode *)malloc(sizeof(StackNode));
    if (!newNode) return 0; // 内存分配失败
    newNode->data = e; // 设置新节点的数据
    newNode->next = S->top; // 新节点指向当前栈顶
    S->top = newNode; // 更新栈顶指针
    return 1; // 入栈成功
}


出栈(pop)

// 顺序栈出栈
int Pop(SqStack *S, int *e) {
    if (S->top == -1) return 0; // 栈空，无法出栈
    *e = S->data[(S->top)--]; // 元素出栈
    return 1; // 出栈成功
}
// 链式栈出栈
int Pop(LinkStack *S, int *e) {
    if (S->top == NULL) return 0; // 栈空，无法出栈
    StackNode *temp = S->top; // 临时保存栈顶节点
    *e = temp->data; // 获取栈顶元素
    S->top = S->top->next; // 更新栈顶指针
    free(temp); // 释放出栈节点的内存
    return 1; // 出栈成功
}


获取栈顶元素(peek)

// 顺序栈获取栈顶元素
int Peek(SqStack *S, int *e) {
    if (S->top == -1) return 0; // 栈空，无法获取栈顶元素
    *e = S->data[S->top]; // 获取栈顶元素，数组访问，S->data[ S->top ] 翻译过来就是 S指向的数组[ S指向的下标 ]
    return 1; // 获取成功
}
// 链式栈获取栈顶元素
int Peek(LinkStack *S, int *e) {
    if (S->top == NULL) return 0; // 栈空，无法获取栈顶元素
    *e = S->top->data; // 获取栈顶元素
    return 1; // 获取成功
}


队列

队列(queue)是限定仅在表的前端进行删除操作，而在表的后端进行插入操作的线性表。队列遵循“先进先出”(FIFO, First In First Out)的原则。
队列的基本操作包括入队(enqueue)、出队(dequeue)和获取队头元素(front)。
示意图：

入队 (Enqueue)                     出队 (Dequeue)
           |                                   ^
           v                                   |
    +---------------------------------------------+
    |  元素 D  |  元素 C  |  元素 B  |  元素 A    |
    +---------------------------------------------+
       ^                                   ^
       |                                   |
   队尾 (Rear)                         队头 (Front)


队列的顺序结构-初始化

#define MAXSIZE 100
typedef struct {
    int data[MAXSIZE]; // 存储队列元素的数组
    int front;         // 队头下标
    int rear;          // 队尾下标，指向下一个待插入位置
} SqQueue;

// 初始化队列
void InitQueue(SqQueue *Q) {
    Q->front = 0; 
    Q->rear = 0;  // 初始时队列为空，front == rear
}


队列的链式结构-初始化

typedef struct QNode {
    int data;               // 队列元素
    struct QNode *next;     // 指向下一个节点的指针
} QNode;
typedef struct {
    QNode *front; // 队头指针
    QNode *rear;  // 队尾指针
} LinkQueue;
// 初始化队列
void InitQueue(LinkQueue *Q) {
    Q->front = Q->rear = NULL; // 队头和队尾指针初始化为NULL，表示队列为空
}


队列的基本操作

入队(enqueue)

// 顺序队列入队
int Enqueue(SqQueue *Q, int e) {
    if ((Q->rear + 1) % MAXSIZE == Q->front) return 0; // 队列满，无法入队
    Q->data[Q->rear] = e; // 元素入队
    Q->rear = (Q->rear + 1) % MAXSIZE; // 更新队尾指针
    return 1; // 入队成功
}
// 链式队列入队
int Enqueue(LinkQueue *Q, int e) {
    QNode *newNode = (QNode *)malloc(sizeof(QNode));
    if (!newNode) return 0; // 内存分配失败
    newNode->data = e; // 设置新节点的数据
    newNode->next = NULL; // 新节点的下一个指针为NULL
    if (Q->rear) {
        Q->rear->next = newNode; // 将新节点链接到队尾
    } else {
        Q->front = newNode; // 队列为空时，更新队头指针
    }
    Q->rear = newNode; // 更新队尾指针
    return 1; // 入队成功
}


出队(dequeue)

// 顺序队列出队
int Dequeue(SqQueue *Q, int *e) {
    if (Q->front == Q->rear) return 0; // 队列空，无法出队
    *e = Q->data[Q->front]; // 元素出队
    Q->front = (Q->front + 1) % MAXSIZE; // 更新队头指针
    return 1; // 出队成功
}
// 链式队列出队
int Dequeue(LinkQueue *Q, int *e) {
    if (Q->front == NULL) return 0; // 队列空，无法出队
    QNode *temp = Q->front; // 临时保存队头节点
    *e = temp->data; // 获取队头元素
    Q->front = Q->front->next; // 更新队头指针
    if (Q->front == NULL) {
        Q->rear = NULL; // 队列为空时，更新队尾指针
    }
    free(temp); // 释放出队节点的内存
    return 1; // 出队成功
}


获取队头元素(front)

// 顺序队列获取队头元素
int Front(SqQueue *Q, int *e) {
    if (Q->front == Q->rear) return 0; // 队列空，无法获取队头元素
    *e = Q->data[Q->front]; // 获取队头元素
    return 1; // 获取成功
}
// 链式队列获取队头元素
int Front(LinkQueue *Q, int *e) {
    if (Q->front == NULL) return 0; // 队列空，无法获取队头元素
    *e = Q->front->data; // 获取队头元素
    return 1; // 获取成功
}


队列动态内存分配示例

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define MAXSIZE 100
typedef struct {
    int *data; // 动态分配的数组
    int front; // 队头下标
    int rear;  // 队尾下标
    int capacity; // 队列容量
} DynamicSqQueue;
// 初始化动态队列
void InitDynamicQueue(DynamicSqQueue *Q, int capacity) {
    Q->data = (int *)malloc(capacity * sizeof(int));
    Q->front = 0;
    Q->rear = 0;
    Q->capacity = capacity;
}
// 释放动态队列内存
void FreeDynamicQueue(DynamicSqQueue *Q) {
    free(Q->data);
}


队列的顺序结构-循环队列

#define MAXSIZE 100
typedef struct {
    int data[MAXSIZE]; // 存储队列元素的数组
    int front;         // 队头下标
    int rear;          // 队尾下标，指向下一个待插入位置
} CircularQueue;
// 初始化循环队列
void InitCircularQueue(CircularQueue *Q) {
    Q->front = 0; 
    Q->rear = 0;  // 初始时队列为空，front == rear
}


循环队列入队(enqueue)

int Enqueue(CircularQueue *Q, int e) {
    if ((Q->rear + 1) % MAXSIZE == Q->front) return 0; // 队列满，无法入队
    Q->data[Q->rear] = e; // 元素入队
    Q->rear = (Q->rear + 1) % MAXSIZE; // 更新队尾指针
    return 1; // 入队成功
}


循环队列出队(dequeue)

int Dequeue(CircularQueue *Q, int *e) {
    if (Q->front == Q->rear) return 0; // 队列空，无法出队
    *e = Q->data[Q->front]; // 元素出队
    Q->front = (Q->front + 1) % MAXSIZE; // 更新队头指针
    return 1; // 出队成功
}


双端队列

双端队列(deque, double-ended queue)是一种允许在两端进行插入和删除操作的线性表。双端队列可以在队头和队尾进行入队和出队操作。]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[线性表

由n个数据特性相同的元素组成的有限序列
线性表中的元素个数n称为线性表的长度，n=0时称为空表

顺序表

线性表的一种存储结构，采用一段地址连续的存储单元依次存放线性表的各个元素

顺序表初始化

#include <stdio.h>
typedef int ElemType; //假设线性表存储的数据类型为整型
#define MAXSIZE 20 //顺序表的最大长度
typedef struct {
    ElemType data[MAXSIZE]; //存储空间
    int length; //当前长度
}SqList;
//顺序表初始化
void initList(SqList *L){
    L->length = 0;
}

int main(){
    SqList List;
    initList(&List);
    printf("线性表初始化完成，当前长度为%d\n", List.length);
    return 0;
}


顺序表在尾部插入元素

int insertAtEnd(SqList *L, ElemType e){
    if(L->length >= MAXSIZE){
        return 0; //顺序表已满，插入失败
    }
    L->data[L->length] = e; //在末尾插入元素，当顺序表为空时，L->length为0，插入在data[0]
    L->length++; //长度加1
    return 1; //插入成功
}


顺序表遍历

void traverseList(SqList L){
    for(int i = 0; i < L.length; i++){
        printf("%d ", L.data[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}


顺序表在指定位置插入元素

int insertAtPosition(SqList *L, int pos, ElemType e){//e为要插入的元素
    if(L->length >= MAXSIZE || pos < 1 || pos > L->length + 1){
        return 0; //顺序表已满或位置不合法，插入失败，pos用来表示插入位置，范围为1到L->length+1
    }
    for(int i = L->length; i >= pos; i--){//从后向前遍历
        L->data[i] = L->data[i - 1]; //将插入位置及其后的元素后移
    }
    L->data[pos - 1] = e; //插入元素
    L->length++; //长度加1
    return 1; //插入成功
}


顺序表插入数据最好的时间复杂度

O(1)，在表尾插入元素时不需要移动其他元素

顺序表插入数据最坏的时间复杂度

O(n)，在表头插入元素时需要移动所有元素

顺序表删除指定位置元素

int deleteAtPosition(SqList *L, int pos, ElemType *e){//*e用来返回删除的元素值
    if(L->length == 0 || pos < 1 || pos > L->length){
        return 0; //顺序表为空或位置不合法，删除失败
    }
    *e = L->data[pos - 1]; //保存被删除的元素，*e用来返回删除的元素值
    for(int i = pos; i < L->length; i++){//从删除位置后一个元素开始遍历
        L->data[i - 1] = L->data[i]; //将删除位置后的元素前移
    }
    L->length--; //长度减1
    return 1; //删除成功
}


顺序表按值查找元素

int findByValue(SqList L, ElemType e){
    for(int i = 0; i < L.length; i++){
        if(L.data[i] == e){
            return i + 1; //返回元素位置，位置从1开始
        }
    }
    return -1; //未找到元素
}


顺序表按位置查找元素

int findByPosition(SqList L, int pos, ElemType *e){
    if(pos < 1 || pos > L.length){
        return 0; //位置不合法，查找失败
    }
    *e = L.data[pos - 1]; //返回元素值
    return 1; //查找成功
}


顺序表动态分配内地址初始化

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
typedef int ElemType; //假设线性表存储的数据类型为整型
typedef struct {
    ElemType *data; //存储空间
    int length; //当前长度
    int capacity; //当前分配的存储容量
}SqList;
//顺序表初始化
void initList(SqList *L, int initialCapacity){//initialCapacity为初始容量,SqList* L表示顺序表的指针
    L->data = (ElemType *)malloc(initialCapacity * sizeof(ElemType)); //动态分配存储空间
    L->length = 0; //当前长度为0
    L->capacity = initialCapacity; //设置初始容量
}
int main(){
    SqList List;
    initList(&List, 10); //初始化顺序表，初始容量为10
    printf("线性表初始化完成，当前长度为%d，容量为%d\n", List.length, List.capacity);
    free(List.data); //释放动态分配的内存
    return 0;
}


清空顺序表

void clearList(SqList *L){
    L->length = 0; //将长度设为0，逻辑上清空顺序表
}


销毁顺序表

void destroyList(SqList *L){
    free(L->data); //释放动态分配的存储空间
    L->data = NULL; //将指针置为NULL，防止悬空指针
    L->length = 0; //将长度设为0
    L->capacity = 0; //将容量设为0
}


顺序表的优缺点

优点：

支持随机访问，可以通过下标快速访问任意位置的元素，时间复杂度为O(1)

缺点：

插入和删除操作效率较低，尤其是在表头或中间位置插
入或删除元素时，需要移动大量元素，时间复杂度为O(n)需要预先分配连续的存储空间，可能导致内存浪费或内存不足的问题

链表

链表是一种线性表的存储结构，由一系列节点组成，每个节点包含数据域和指针域，指针域指向下一个节点
示意图：

NULL <- [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> NULL


单链表

单链表节点定义

typedef struct Node {
    ElemType data; //数据域
    struct Node* next; //指针域，指向下一个节点
} Node;


单链表初始化

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
typedef int ElemType; //假设线性表存储的数据类型为整型
typedef struct Node {
    ElemType data; //数据域
    struct Node* next; //指针域，指向下一个节点
} Node;
typedef struct {
    Node* head; //头指针
} LinkedList;
//单链表初始化
void initList(LinkedList* L){
    L->head = NULL; //头指针初始化为NULL
}
int main(){
    LinkedList List;
    initList(&List);
    printf("单链表初始化完成，头指针为%p\n", (void*)List.head);
    return 0;
}


单链表头插法

int insertAtHead(LinkedList* L, ElemType e){
    Node* newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node)); //创建新节点
    if(newNode == NULL){
        return 0; //内存分配失败，插入失败
    }
    newNode->data = e; //设置新节点的数据域
    newNode->next = L->head; //新节点指向当前头节点
    L->head = newNode; //更新头指针指向新节点
    return 1; //插入成功
}


单链表尾插法

int insertAtEnd(LinkedList* L, ElemType e){
    Node* newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node)); //创建新节点
    if(newNode == NULL){
        return 0; //内存分配失败，插入失败
    }
    newNode->data = e; //设置新节点的数据域
    newNode->next = NULL; //新节点的下一个节点为NULL
    if(L->head == NULL){
        L->head = newNode; //如果链表为空，新节点成为头节点
    } else {
        Node* current = L->head;
        while(current->next != NULL){
            current = current->next; //遍历到链表的最后一个节点
        }
        current->next = newNode; //将最后一个节点的next指向新节点
    }
    return 1; //插入成功
}


单链表遍历

void traverseList(LinkedList L){
    Node* current = L.head; //从头节点开始遍历
    while(current != NULL){
        printf("%d ", current->data); //打印当前节点的数据域
        current = current->next; //移动到下一个节点
    }
    printf("\n");
}


单链表在指定位置插入元素

int insertAtPosition(LinkedList* L, int pos, ElemType e){//pos表示插入位置，范围从1开始
    if(pos < 1){
        return 0; //位置不合法，插入失败
    }
    if(pos == 1){
        return insertAtHead(L, e); //在头部插入
    }
    Node* current = L->head;
    for(int i = 1; i < pos - 1 && current != NULL; i++){
        current = current->next; //移动到插入位置的前一个节点
    }
    if(current == NULL){
        return 0; //位置超出链表长度，插入失败
    }
    Node* newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node)); //创建新节点
    if(newNode == NULL){
        return 0; //内存分配失败，插入失败
    }
    newNode->data = e; //设置新节点的数据域
    newNode->next = current->next; //新节点指向当前节点的下一个节点
    current->next = newNode; //当前节点指向新节点
    return 1; //插入成功
}


单链表删除指定位置元素

int deleteAtPosition(LinkedList* L, int pos, ElemType* e){//*e用来返回删除的元素值
    if(pos < 1 || L->head == NULL){
        return 0; //位置不合法或链表为空，删除失败
    }
    Node* current = L->head;//current是用来遍历链表的指针，初始指向头节点
    if(pos == 1){
        *e = current->data; //保存被删除的元素
        L->head = current->next; //更新头指针
        free(current); //释放被删除节点的内存
        return 1; //删除成功
    }
    for(int i = 1; i < pos - 1 && current != NULL; i++){
        current = current->next; //移动到删除位置的前一个节点
    }
    if(current == NULL || current->next == NULL){
        return 0; //位置超出链表长度，删除失败
    }
    Node* temp = current->next; //待删除节点
    *e = temp->data; //保存被删除的元素
    current->next = temp->next; //前一个节点指向待删除节点的下一个节点
    free(temp); //释放被删除节点的内存
    return 1; //删除成功
}


获取单链表长度

int getListLength(LinkedList L){
    int length = 0;
    Node* current = L.head; //从头节点开始遍历
    while(current != NULL){
        length++; //长度加1
        current = current->next; //移动到下一个节点
    }
    return length; //返回链表长度
}


单链表按值查找元素

int findByValue(LinkedList L, ElemType e){
    Node* current = L.head; //从头节点开始遍历
    int pos = 1; //位置从1开始
    while(current != NULL){
        if(current->data == e){
            return pos; //返回元素位置
        }
        current = current->next; //移动到下一个节点
        pos++;
    }
    return -1; //未找到元素
}


单链表按位置查找元素

int findByPosition(LinkedList L, int pos, ElemType* e){
    if(pos < 1){
        return 0; //位置不合法，查找失败
    }
    Node* current = L.head;
    for(int i = 1; i < pos && current != NULL; i++){
        current = current->next; //移动到指定位置的节点
    }
    if(current == NULL){
        return 0; //位置超出链表长度，查找失败
    }
    *e = current->data; //返回元素值
    return 1; //查找成功
}


清空单链表

void clearList(LinkedList* L){
    Node* current = L->head;//从头节点开始遍历
    Node* temp;//用来保存当前节点的指针
    while(current != NULL){//遍历链表
        temp = current;//保存当前节点
        current = current->next;//移动到下一个节点
        free(temp); //释放每个节点的内存
    }
    L->head = NULL; //将头指针置为NULL
}


销毁单链表

void destroyList(LinkedList* L){
    clearList(L); //清空链表
    L->head = NULL; //将头指针置为NULL
}


单链表应用-反转链表

void reverseList(LinkedList* L){ 
    Node* prev = NULL; //前一个节点初始化为NULL
    Node* current = L->head; //当前节点初始化为头节点
    Node* next = NULL; //下一个节点初始化为NULL
    while(current != NULL){
        next = current->next; //保存下一个节点
        current->next = prev; //将当前节点的next指向前一个节点
        prev = current; //移动前一个节点到当前节点
        current = next; //移动当前节点到下一个节点
    }
    L->head = prev; //更新头指针指向新的头节点
}


示意图：

初始链表:  head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL
反转过程:
1. prev=NULL, current=1, next=2
   head -> 1 -> NULL
          ^
          |
         prev
2. prev=1, current=2, next=3
   head -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
            ^
            |
             prev
3. prev=2, current=3, next=NULL
   head -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
最终链表: head -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL


单链表应用-删除链表中间节点

void deleteMiddleNode(LinkedList* L){
    if(L->head == NULL || L->head->next == NULL){
        return; //链表为空或只有一个节点，无法删除中间节点
    }
    Node* slow = L->head; //慢指针初始化为头节点
    Node* fast = L->head; //快指针初始化为头节点
    Node* prev = NULL; //前一个节点初始化为NULL

    while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL){
        prev = slow; //保存慢指针的前一个节点
        slow = slow->next; //慢指针移动一步
        fast = fast->next->next; //快指针移动两步
    }
    //此时慢指针指向中间节点，prev指向中间节点的前一个节点
    prev->next = slow->next; //将前一个节点的next指向中间节点的下一个节点
    free(slow); //释放中间节点的内存
}


单链表应用-判断链表是否有环

int hasCycle(LinkedList L){
    Node* slow = L.head; //慢指针初始化为头节点
    Node* fast = L.head; //快指针初始化为头节点

    while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL){
        slow = slow->next; //慢指针移动一步
        fast = fast->next->next; //快指针移动两步
        if(slow == fast){
            return 1; //链表有环
        }
    }
    return 0; //链表无环
}


原理：如果链表有环，快慢指针最终会在环内相遇；如果链表无环，快指针会先到达链表末尾。

判断环的入口

Node* detectCycle(LinkedList L){
    Node* slow = L.head; //慢指针初始化为头节点
    Node* fast = L.head; //快指针初始化为头节点

    //首先判断链表是否有环
    while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL){
        slow = slow->next; //慢指针移动一步
        fast = fast->next->next; //快指针移动两步
        if(slow == fast){
            break; //链表有环，跳出循环
        }
    }
    if(fast == NULL || fast->next == NULL){
        return NULL; //链表无环，返回NULL
    }
    //链表有环，找到环的入口
    slow = L.head; //将慢指针重新指向头节点
    while(slow != fast){
        slow = slow->next; //慢指针移动一步
        fast = fast->next; //快指针移动一步
    }
    return slow; //返回环的入口节点
}


原理：当快慢指针相遇时，将慢指针重新指向头节点，然后两个指针每次移动一步，最终会在环的入口节点相遇。

双向链表

为克服单链表只能单向遍历的缺点，双向链表在每个节点中增加一个指向前驱节点的指针，实现双向遍历。
双向链表是一种线性表的存储结构，由一系列节点组成，每个节点包含数据域、前驱指针域和后继指针域。
示意图：

NULL <- [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] <-> [Prev|Data|Next] -> NULL


双向链表节点定义

typedef struct DNode {
    ElemType data; //数据域
    struct DNode* prev; //前驱指针域，指向前一个节点
    struct DNode* next; //后继指针域，指向下一个节点
} DNode;


双向链表初始化

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
typedef int ElemType; //假设线性表存储的数据类型为整型
typedef struct DNode {
    ElemType data; //数据域
    struct DNode* prev; //前驱指针域，指向前一个节点
    struct DNode* next; //后继指针域，指向下一个节点
} DNode;
typedef struct {
    DNode* head; //头指针
    DNode* tail; //尾指针
} DoublyLinkedList;
//双向链表初始化
void initList(DoublyLinkedList* L){
    L->head = NULL; //头指针初始化为NULL
    L->tail = NULL; //尾指针初始化为NULL
}
int main(){
    DoublyLinkedList List;
    initList(&List);
    printf("双向链表初始化完成，头指针为%p，尾指针为%p\n", (void*)List.head, (void*)List.tail);
    return 0;
}


双向链表尾插法

int insertAtEnd(DoublyLinkedList* L, ElemType e){
    DNode* newNode = (DNode*)malloc(sizeof(DNode)); //创建新节点
    if(newNode == NULL){
        return 0; //内存分配失败，插入失败
    }
    newNode->data = e; //设置新节点的数据域
    newNode->next = NULL; //新节点的下一个节点为NULL
    if(L->tail == NULL){
        newNode->prev = NULL; //如果链表为空，新节点的前驱指针为NULL
        L->head = newNode; //新节点成为头节点
        L->tail = newNode; //新节点成为尾节点
    } else {
        newNode->prev = L->tail; //新节点的前驱指针指向当前尾节点
        L->tail->next = newNode; //当前尾节点的next指向新节点
        L->tail = newNode; //更新尾指针指向新节点
    }
    return 1; //插入成功
}


双向链表头插法

int insertAtHead(DoublyLinkedList* L, ElemType e){
    DNode* newNode = (DNode*)malloc(sizeof(DNode)); //创建新节点
    if(newNode == NULL){
        return 0; //内存分配失败，插入失败
    }
    newNode->data = e; //设置新节点的数据域
    newNode->prev = NULL; //新节点的前驱指针为NULL
    if(L->head == NULL){
        newNode->next = NULL; //如果链表为空，新节点的下一个节点为NULL
        L->head = newNode; //新节点成为头节点
        L->tail = newNode; //新节点成为尾节点
    } else {
        newNode->next = L->head; //新节点的next指向当前头节点
        L->head->prev = newNode; //当前头节点的prev指向新节点
        L->head = newNode; //更新头指针指向新节点
    }
    return 1; //插入成功
}


双向链表删除节点

int deleteNode(DoublyLinkedList* L, DNode* node, ElemType* e){//*e用来返回删除的元素值
    if(node == NULL){
        return 0; //节点为空，删除失败
    }
    *e = node->data; //保存被删除的元素
    if(node->prev != NULL){
        node->prev->next = node->next; //前驱节点的next指向后继节点
    } else {
        L->head = node->next; //如果删除的是头节点，更新头指针
    }
    if(node->next != NULL){
        node->next->prev = node->prev; //后继节点的prev指向前驱节点
    } else {
        L->tail = node->prev; //如果删除的是尾节点，更新尾指针
    }
    free(node); //释放被删除节点的内存
    return 1; //删除成功
}


双向链表遍历

void traverseList(DoublyLinkedList L){
    DNode* current = L.head; //从头节点开始遍历
    while(current != NULL){
        printf("%d ", current->data); //打印当前节点的数据域
        current = current->next; //移动到下一个节点
    }
    printf("\n");
}


链表和顺序表的比较

特性顺序表链表存储结构连续存储空间非连续存储空间存储密度不用为表示节点间的逻辑关系而增加额外的存储，存储密度等于1需要为每个节点增加指针域，存储密度小于1存储元素随机存取，按位置访问元素的时间复杂度为O(1)只能顺序存取，按位置访问元素的时间复杂度为O(n)访问方式支持随机访问，时间复杂度O(1)只能顺序访问，时间复杂度O(n)插入和删除需要移动元素，时间复杂度O(n)只需修改指针，时间复杂度O(1)内存利用率可能浪费内存或内存不足适用场景1.表长变化不大，且能事先确定变化的范围 <br>2.很少进行插入和删除操作，经常按元素位置序号访问数据元素1.表长变化较大，无法事先确定变化范围 <br>2.经常进行插入和删除操作

双指针

双指针是一种常用的算法技巧，通常用于遍历和处理线性数据结构（如数组和链表）。双指针技术通过使用两个指针同时遍历数据结构，可以有效地解决一些问题，如查找、排序和合并等。
双指针的基本思想是使用两个指针分别指向数据结构中的不同位置，通过移动这两个指针来实现特定的操作。根据指针的移动方式，双指针技术可以分为以下几种类型：

对撞指针（Two-pointer technique）：两个指针分别从数据结构的两端开始向中间移动，常用于查找满足特定条件的元素对。例如，在有序数组中查找两个数之和等于目标值的问题。快慢指针（Fast and slow pointer）：一个指针以较快的速度移动，另一个指针以较慢的速度移动，常用于检测链表中的环或找到链表的中间节点。例如，在链表中检测是否存在环的问题。滑动窗口（Sliding window）：使用两个指针定义一个窗口，在数据结构中滑动该窗口以满足特定条件，常用于解决子数组或子串的问题。例如，在字符串中查找最长无重复字符的子串的问题。

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[数组与sizeof运算符

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a[]={1,2,3,4,5};
    for(int i=0;i<sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);i++) {
        printf("%d\n ",a[i]);
    }
}
printf("%zu\n",sizeof(a)); //20
printf("%zu\n",sizeof(a[0])); //4


在C语言中，数组名代表整个数组，因此使用 sizeof运算符时，返回的是整个数组所占的字节数，而不是指针的大小。通过将数组的总大小除以单个元素的大小，可以计算出数组中的元素数量。

指针

指针的定义

指针是用来存放地址的变量，指针变量存放的是另一个变量的地址，通过指针可以间接访问和操作该变量的值。

int a; //定义一个整型变量a
int *p; //定义一个整型指针变量p
int* p; //定义一个整型指针变量p
int * p; //定义一个整型指针变量p


使用指针

int a = 5;
int *p = &a; //将变量a的地址赋值给指针p
printf("%d\n", *p); //通过指针访问变量a的值，输出5
printf("p的值是:%p\n", p); //输出指针p存储的地址
printf("a的地址是:%p\n", &a); //输出变量a的地址


间接引用操作符*

间接引用操作符 *用于访问指针所指向的变量的值。通过在指针前加上 *，可以获取或修改该变量的值。
通常叫做“解引用指针”

int a =5;
int* p = &a; //将变量a的地址赋值给指针p
printf("%d\n", *p); //通过指针访问变量a的值，输出5
*p = 10; //通过指针修改变量a的值
printf("%d\n", a); //输出修改后的变量a的值，输出10


指针与函数

设计一个函数，通过指针参数交换两个整数的值。

#include <stdio.h>
void swap(int* x, int* y) {
    int temp = *x; //保存x指向的值
    *x = *y; //将y指向的值赋给x指向的值
    *y = temp; //将temp的值赋给y指向的值
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    printf("交换前:a=%d, b=%d\n", a, b);//交换前:a=5, b=10
    swap(&a, &b); //传递变量a和b的地址
    printf("交换后:a=%d, b=%d\n", a, b);//交换后:a=10, b=5
    return 0;
}


指针与数组

数组名本质上是一个指向数组第一个元素的指针，因此可以通过指针来访问和操作数组元素。

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int* p = a; //将数组名赋值给指针p

    printf("%d\n",a); //输出数组a的首地址
    printf("%p\n", p); //输出指针p的值，即数组a的首地址
    printf("%d\n", *p); //通过指针访问第一个元素，输出1
}


通过指针运算，可以遍历数组元素：

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int* p = a; //将数组名赋值给指针p

    for(int i = 0; i < sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]); i++) {
        printf("%d\n", *(p + i)); //通过指针运算访问数组元素
    }
}


给指针加上一个整数，实际上加的是该类型所占的字节数乘以这个整数。

结构体

结构体是一种用户自定义的数据类型，用于将不同类型的数据组合在一起，形成一个整体。结构体可以包含多个成员变量，每个成员变量可以是不同的数据类型。

结构体的定义

struct Person {
    char name[50]; //姓名
    int age; //年龄
    float height; //身高
};


结构体变量的定义与初始化

struct Person person1; //定义一个结构体变量person1
struct Person person2 = {"Alice", 30, 5.5}; //定义并初始化结构体变量person2


结构体与指针

#include <stdio.h>
struct point* pp;
(*pp).x = 10; //通过解引用操作符访问结构体成员
pp->y = 20; //通过箭头操作符访问结构体成员


类型定义

使用 typedef关键字为结构体定义一个新的类型名称，简化结构体变量的定义。

typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
} Person;
Person person1; //定义一个结构体变量person1
Person person2 = {"Bob", 25, 6.0}; //定义并初始化结构体变量person2


结构体作为函数参数

#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
} Person;

void printPerson(Person p) {
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", p.name, p.age);
}

int main() {
    Person person = {"Charlie", 28};
    printPerson(person); //传递结构体变量作为参数，结果输出: Name: Charlie, Age: 28
    return 0;
}


结构体指针作为函数参数

#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
} Person;

void printPerson(Person* p) {
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", p->name, p->age);
}

int main() {
    Person person = {"Diana", 32};
    printPerson(&person); //传递结构体变量的地址作为参数，结果输出: Name: Diana, Age: 32
    return 0;
}


内存

内存分类

静态内存：在程序编译时分配，生命周期贯穿整个程序运行期间。包括全局变量、静态变量和常量。自动内存（栈内存）：在函数调用时分配，函数返回时释放。用于存储局部变量和函数参数。动态内存（堆内存）：在程序运行时动态分配，需要手动释放。

动态内存分配

动态内存分配允许在程序运行时根据需要分配和释放内存。
使用 malloc、calloc、realloc和 free函数进行动态内存管理。
malloc（memory allocate）：分配指定字节数的内存，返回指向该内存块的指针。
void* malloc(size_t size);

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {//argc参数表示命令行参数的数量，argv参数是一个字符串数组，存储命令行参数的具体内容
    int* p =(int*)malloc(sizeof(int)); //(int*)强制类型转换,(sizeof(int))分配一个整数大小的内存
    if(p == NULL) {//检查内存分配是否成功
        printf("内存分配失败\n");
        return 1;
    }
    *p = 42;
    printf("分配的整数值: %d\n", *p);
    free(p); //释放内存
    return 0;
}


字符串数组

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char* str = (char*)malloc(100 * sizeof(char)); //分配100个字符的内存
    if(str == NULL) {
        printf("内存分配失败\n");
        return 1;
    }
    strcpy(str, "Hello, World!");
    printf("%s\n", str);
    free(str); //释放内存
    return 0;
}


结构体

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
} Person;

int main() {
    Person* p = (Person*)malloc(sizeof(Person)); //分配一个Person结构体的内存
    if(p == NULL) {
        printf("内存分配失败\n");
        return 1;
    }
    strcpy(p->name, "Eve");//strcpy函数用于将字符串复制到结构体的name成员中
    p->age = 29;
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", p->name, p->age);
    free(p); //释放内存
    return 0;
}


算法分析

算法分析是评估算法在执行过程中所需资源（如时间和空间）的过程。常用的时间复杂度表示法有大O符号（Big O notation），用于描述算法的增长率。
算法+数据结构=程序

时间复杂度

时间复杂度表示算法执行所需时间与输入规模之间的关系。常见的时间复杂度有：

O(1)：常数时间复杂度，表示算法的执行时间不随输入规模变化而变化。O(log n)：对数时间复杂度，表示算法的执行时间随着输入规模的增加而以对数速度增长。O(n)：线性时间复杂度，表示算法的执行时间与输入规模成正比。O(n log n)：线性对数时间复杂度，常见于高效的排序算法，如快速排序和归并排序。O(n^2)：平方时间复杂度，表示算法的执行时间与输入规模的平方成正比，常见于简单的排序算法，如冒泡排序和选择排序。O(2^n)：指数时间复杂度，表示算法的执行时间随着输入规模的增加呈指数增长，通常用于解决组合问题。

计算时间复杂度

计算时间复杂度通常通过分析算法中的基本操作执行次数来完成。

循环结构：分析循环的执行次数。例如，一个简单的for循环执行n次，其时间复杂度为O(n)。

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    //基本操作
}


时间复杂度为O(n)。

嵌套循环：分析嵌套循环的执行次数。例如，一个嵌套的for循环，每个循环都执行n次，其时间复杂度为O(n^2)。

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        //基本操作
    }
}


时间复杂度为O(n^2)。

条件语句：分析条件语句中的执行路径。例如，一个if-else语句，其时间复杂度取决于最长的执行路径。

if(condition) {
    //基本操作1
} else {
    //基本操作2
}


时间复杂度为O(1)。

函数调用：分析函数调用的时间复杂度。例如，如果一个函数调用的时间复杂度为O(f(n))，那么调用该函数的时间复杂度也为O(f(n))。

void func(int n) {
    //基本操作
}
func(n);


时间复杂度为O(f(n))。

O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2) < O(2^n)

抽象数据类型ADT

抽象数据类型（Abstract Data Type，ADT）是一种数学模型，用于定义数据及其相关操作，而不涉及具体的实现细节。ADT强调数据的逻辑结构和行为，使得程序员可以专注于数据的使用，而不必关心其底层实现。]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[JavaScript 简介

什么是 JavaScript？

JavaScript 最初被创建的目的是“使网页更生动”。
这种编程语言写出来的程序被称为 脚本。它们可以被直接写在网页的 HTML 中，在页面加载的时候自动执行。
脚本被以纯文本的形式提供和执行。它们不需要特殊的准备或编译即可运行。
这方面，JavaScript 和 Java 有很大的区别。

为什么叫 JavaScript？

JavaScript 在刚诞生的时候，它的名字叫 “LiveScript”。但是因为当时 Java 很流行，所以决定将一种新语言定位为 Java 的“弟弟”会有助于它的流行。
随着 JavaScript 的发展，它已经成为了一门完全独立的语言，并且也拥有了自己的语言规范 ECMAScript。现在，它和 Java 之间没有任何关系。

如今，JavaScript 不仅可以在浏览器中执行，也可以在服务端执行，甚至可以在任意搭载了 JavaScript 引擎 的设备中执行。
浏览器中嵌入了 JavaScript 引擎，有时也称作“JavaScript 虚拟机”。
不同的引擎有不同的“代号”，例如：

V8 —— Chrome、Opera 和 Edge 中的 JavaScript 引擎。SpiderMonkey —— Firefox 中的 JavaScript 引擎。……还有其他一些代号，像 “Chakra” 用于 IE，“JavaScriptCore”、“Nitro” 和 “SquirrelFish” 用于 Safari，等等。

上面这些术语很容易记住，因为它们经常出现在开发者的文章中。我们也会用到这些术语。例如，如果“V8 支持某个功能”，那么我们可以认为这个功能大概能在 Chrome、Opera 和 Edge 中正常运行。

引擎是如何工作的？

引擎很复杂，但是基本原理很简单。

引擎（如果是浏览器，则引擎被嵌入在其中）读取（“解析”）脚本。然后，引擎将脚本转化（“编译”）为机器语言。然后，机器代码快速地执行。

引擎会对流程中的每个阶段都进行优化。它甚至可以在编译的脚本运行时监视它，分析流经该脚本的数据，并根据获得的信息进一步优化机器代码。

浏览器中的 JavaScript 能做什么？

现代的 JavaScript 是一种“安全的”编程语言。它不提供对内存或 CPU 的底层访问，因为它最初是为浏览器创建的，不需要这些功能。
JavaScript 的能力很大程度上取决于它运行的环境。例如，Node.js 支持允许 JavaScript 读取/写入任意文件，执行网络请求等的函数。
浏览器中的 JavaScript 可以做与网页操作、用户交互和 Web 服务器相关的所有事情。

例如，浏览器中的 JavaScript 可以做下面这些事：

在网页中添加新的 HTML，修改网页已有内容和网页的样式。响应用户的行为，响应鼠标的点击，指针的移动，按键的按动。向远程服务器发送网络请求，下载和上传文件（所谓的 AJAX 和 COMET 技术）。获取或设置 cookie，向访问者提出问题或发送消息。记住客户端的数据（“本地存储”）。

浏览器中的 JavaScript 不能做什么？

为了用户的（信息）安全，在浏览器中的 JavaScript 的能力是受限的。目的是防止恶意网页获取用户私人信息或损害用户数据。
此类限制的例子包括：

网页中的 JavaScript 不能读、写、复制和执行硬盘上的任意文件。它没有直接访问操作系统的功能。现代浏览器允许 JavaScript 做一些文件相关的操作，但是这个操作是受到限制的。仅当用户做出特定的行为，JavaScript 才能操作这个文件。例如，用户把文件“拖放”到浏览器中，或者通过 <input> 标签选择了文件。有很多与相机/麦克风和其它设备进行交互的方式，但是这些都需要获得用户的明确许可。因此，启用了 JavaScript 的网页应该不会偷偷地启动网络摄像头观察你，并把你的信息发送到 美国国家安全局。不同的标签页/窗口之间通常互不了解。有时候，也会有一些联系，例如一个标签页通过 JavaScript 打开的另外一个标签页。但即使在这种情况下，如果两个标签页打开的不是同一个网站（域名、协议或者端口任一不相同的网站），它们都不能相互通信。这就是所谓的“同源策略”。为了解决“同源策略”问题，两个标签页必须 都 包含一些处理这个问题的特定的 JavaScript 代码，并均允许数据交换。本教程会讲到这部分相关的知识。这个限制也是为了用户的信息安全。例如，用户打开的 https://www.google.com/ 网页必须不能访问 http://gmail.com（另外一个标签页打开的网页）也不能从那里窃取信息。JavaScript 可以轻松地通过互联网与当前页面所在的服务器进行通信。但是从其他网站/域的服务器中接收数据的能力被削弱了。尽管可以，但是需要来自远程服务器的明确协议（在 HTTP header 中）。这也是为了用户的信息安全。

如果在浏览器环境外（例如在服务器上）使用 JavaScript，则不存在此类限制。现代浏览器还允许安装可能会要求扩展权限的插件/扩展。

是什么使得 JavaScript 与众不同？

至少有 3 件事值得一提：

与 HTML/CSS 完全集成。简单的事，简单地完成。被所有的主流浏览器支持，并且默认开启。

JavaScript 是将这三件事结合在一起的唯一的浏览器技术。
这就是为什么 JavaScript 与众不同。这也是为什么它是用于创建浏览器界面的使用最广泛的工具。
此外，JavaScript 还可用于创建服务器和移动端应用程序等。

JavaScript “上层”语言

不同的人想要不同的功能。JavaScript 的语法也不能满足所有人的需求。
这是正常的，因为每个人的项目和需求都不一样。
因此，最近出现了许多新语言，这些语言在浏览器中执行之前，都会被 编译（转化）成 JavaScript。
现代化的工具使得编译速度非常快且透明，实际上允许开发者使用另一种语言编写代码并会将其“自动转换”为 JavaScript。

此类语言的示例有：

CoffeeScript 是 JavaScript 的一种语法糖。它引入了更加简短的语法，使我们可以编写更清晰简洁的代码。通常，Ruby 开发者喜欢它。TypeScript 专注于添加“严格的数据类型”以简化开发，以更好地支持复杂系统的开发。由微软开发。Flow 也添加了数据类型，但是以一种不同的方式。由 Facebook 开发。Dart 是一门独立的语言。它拥有自己的引擎，该引擎可以在非浏览器环境中运行（例如手机应用），它也可以被编译成 JavaScript。由 Google 开发。Brython 是一个 Python 到 JavaScript 的转译器，让我们可以在不使用 JavaScript 的情况下，以纯 Python 编写应用程序。Kotlin 是一个现代、简洁且安全的编程语言，编写出的应用程序可以在浏览器和 Node 环境中运行。

这样的语言还有很多。当然，即使我们在使用此类编译语言，我们也需要了解 JavaScript。因为了解 JavaScript 才能让我们真正明白我们在做什么。

JavaScript 入门

“script” 标签

我们几乎可以使用 <script> 标签将 JavaScript 程序插入到 HTML 文档的任何位置。
比如：

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>script 标签之前...</p>
  <script>alert('Hello, world!');</script>
  <p>...script 标签之后</p>
</body>
</html>


<script> 标签中包裹了 JavaScript 代码，当浏览器遇到 <script> 标签，代码会自动运行。

外部脚本

如果你有大量的 JavaScript 代码，我们可以将它放入一个单独的文件。
脚本文件可以通过 src 特性添加到 HTML 文件中。

<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>


这里，/path/to/script.js 是脚本文件从网站根目录开始的绝对路径。当然也可以提供当前页面的相对路径。例如，src="script.js"，就像 src="./script.js"，表示当前文件夹中的 "script.js" 文件。

我们也可以提供一个完整的 URL 地址，例如：

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>


要附加多个脚本，请使用多个标签：

<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>


…
请注意：
一般来说，只有最简单的脚本才嵌入到 HTML 中。更复杂的脚本存放在单独的文件中。
使用独立文件的好处是浏览器会下载它，然后将它保存到浏览器的缓存中。
之后，其他页面想要相同的脚本就会从缓存中获取，而不是下载它。所以文件实际上只会下载一次。
这可以节省流量，并使得页面（加载）更快。

如果设置了 src 特性，script 标签内容将会被忽略。
一个单独的 <script> 标签不能同时有 src 特性和内部包裹的代码。
这将不会工作：

<script src="file.js">
    alert(1); // 此内容会被忽略，因为设定了 src
</script>


我们必须进行选择，要么使用外部的 <script src="…">，要么使用正常包裹代码的 <script>。
为了让上面的例子工作，我们可以将它分成两个 <script> 标签。

<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
    alert(1);
</script>


JavaScript 特性

代码结构

语句用分号分隔：

alert('Hello'); alert('World');


通常，换行符也被视为分隔符，因此下面的例子也能正常运行：

alert('Hello')
alert('World')


这就是所谓的「自动分号插入」。但有时它不起作用，例如：

alert("There will be an error after this message")
[1, 2].forEach(alert)


大多数代码风格指南都认为我们应该在每个语句后面都加上分号。
在代码块 {...} 后以及有代码块的语法结构（例如循环）后不需要加分号：

function f() {
  // 函数声明后不需要加分号
}

for(;;) {
  // 循环语句后不需要加分号
}


……但即使我们在某处添加了「额外的」分号，这也不是错误。分号会被忽略的。

严格模式

为了完全启用现代 JavaScript 的所有特性，我们应该在脚本顶部写上 "use strict" 指令。

'use strict';
...


该指令必须位于 JavaScript 脚本的顶部或函数体的开头。
如果没有 "use strict"，所有东西仍可以正常工作，但某些功能将以老式的“兼容”方式运行。我们通常更喜欢现代的方式。

变量

可以使用以下方式声明变量：

letconst（不变的，不能被改变）var（旧式的）

一个变量名可以由以下组成：

字母和数字，但是第一个字符不能是数字。字符 $ 和 _ 是允许的，用法同字母。非拉丁字母和象形文字也是允许的，但通常不会使用。

变量是动态类型的，它们可以存储任何值：

let x = 5;
x = "John";


有 8 种数据类型：

number — 可以是浮点数，也可以是整数，bigint — 用于任意长度的整数，string — 字符串类型，boolean — 逻辑值：true/false，null — 具有单个值 null 的类型，表示“空”或“不存在”，undefined — 具有单个值 undefined 的类型，表示“未分配（未定义）”，object 和 symbol — 对于复杂的数据结构和唯一标识符，我们目前还没学习这个类型。

typeof 运算符返回值的类型，但有两个例外：

typeof null == "object" // JavaScript 编程语言的设计错误
typeof function(){} == "function" // 函数被特殊对待


交互

我们使用浏览器作为工作环境，所以基本的 UI 功能将是：

prompt(question[, default]) 提出一个问题 question，并返回访问者输入的内容，如果他按下「取消」则返回 null。confirm(question) 提出一个问题 question，并建议用户在“确定”和“取消”之间进行选择。选择结果以 true/false 形式返回。alert(message) 输出一个消息 message。

这些函数都会产生 模态框，它们会暂停代码执行并阻止访问者与页面的其他部分进行交互，直到用户做出回答为止。
举个例子：

let userName = prompt("Your name?", "Alice");
let isTeaWanted = confirm("Do you want some tea?");

alert( "Visitor: " + userName ); // Alice
alert( "Tea wanted: " + isTeaWanted ); // true


运算符

JavaScript 支持以下运算符：

算数运算符

常规的：+ - * /（加减乘除），取余运算符 % 和幂运算符 **。
二进制加号 + 可以连接字符串。如果任何一个操作数是一个字符串，那么另一个操作数也将被转换为字符串：

alert( '1' + 2 ); // '12'，字符串
alert( 1 + '2' ); // '12'，字符串
alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41"，不是 "221"
alert('1' + 2 + 2); // "122"，不是 "14"


赋值

简单的赋值：a = b 和合并了其他操作的赋值：a *= 2。

按位运算符

按位运算符在最低位级上操作 32 位的整数

三元运算符

唯一具有三个参数的操作：cond ? resultA : resultB。如果 cond 为真，则返回 resultA，否则返回 resultB。
有时我们需要根据一个条件去赋值一个变量。
如下所示：

let accessAllowed;
let age = prompt('How old are you?', '');

if (age > 18) {
  accessAllowed = true;
} else {
  accessAllowed = false;
}

alert(accessAllowed);


所谓的“条件”或“问号”运算符让我们可以更简短地达到目的。
这个运算符通过问号 ? 表示。有时它被称为三元运算符，被称为“三元”是因为该运算符中有三个操作数。实际上它是 JavaScript 中唯一一个有这么多操作数的运算符。
语法：

let result = condition ? value1 : value2;


计算条件结果，如果结果为真，则返回 value1，否则返回 value2。
例如：

let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;


技术上讲，我们可以省略 age > 18 外面的括号。问号运算符的优先级较低，所以它会在比较运算符 > 后执行。
下面这个示例会执行和前面那个示例相同的操作：

// 比较运算符 "age > 18" 首先执行
//（不需要将其包含在括号中）
let accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;


但括号可以使代码可读性更强，所以我们建议使用它们。
请注意：
在上面的例子中，你可以不使用问号运算符，因为比较本身就返回 true/false：

// 下面代码同样可以实现
let accessAllowed = age > 18;


多个 ‘?’

使用一系列问号 ? 运算符可以返回一个取决于多个条件的值。
例如：

let age = prompt('age?', 18);

let message = (age < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :
  (age < 18) ? 'Hello!' :
  (age < 100) ? 'Greetings!' :
  'What an unusual age!';

alert( message );


可能很难一下子看出发生了什么。但经过仔细观察，我们可以看到它只是一个普通的检查序列。

第一个问号检查 age < 3。如果为真 — 返回 'Hi, baby!'。否则，会继续执行冒号 : 后的表达式，检查 age < 18。如果为真 — 返回 'Hello!'。否则，会继续执行下一个冒号 : 后的表达式，检查 age < 100。如果为真 — 返回 'Greetings!'。否则，会继续执行最后一个冒号 : 后面的表达式，返回 'What an unusual age!'。

这是使用 if..else 实现上面的逻辑的写法：

if (age < 3) {
  message = 'Hi, baby!';
} else if (age < 18) {
  message = 'Hello!';
} else if (age < 100) {
  message = 'Greetings!';
} else {
  message = 'What an unusual age!';
}


‘?’ 的非常规使用

有时可以使用问号 ? 来代替 if 语句：

let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');

(company == 'Netscape') ?alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');


根据条件 company =='Netscape'，要么执行 ? 后面的第一个表达式并显示对应内容，要么执行第二个表达式并显示对应内容。
在这里我们不是把结果赋值给变量。而是根据条件执行不同的代码。
不建议这样使用问号运算符。
这种写法比 if 语句更短，对一些程序员很有吸引力。但它的可读性差。
下面是使用 if 语句实现相同功能的代码，进行下比较：

let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');

if (company == 'Netscape') {
    alert('Right!');
} else {
    alert('Wrong.');
}


因为我们的眼睛垂直扫描代码。所以，跨越几行的代码块比长而水平的代码更易于理解。
问号 ? 的作用是根据条件返回其中一个值。请正确使用它。当需要执行不同的代码分支时，请使用 if。

逻辑运算符

逻辑与 && 和或 || 执行短路运算，然后返回运算停止处的值（true/false 不是必须的）。逻辑非 ! 将操作数转换为布尔值并返回其相反的值。

空值合并运算符

a ?? b 的结果是：

如果 a 是已定义的，则结果为 a，如果 a 不是已定义的，则结果为 b。

换句话说，如果第一个参数不是 null/undefined，则 ?? 返回第一个参数。否则，返回第二个参数。

let user;

alert(user ?? "匿名"); // 匿名（user 未定义）


?? 运算符从一列变量中，选取值为已定义的值（defined value）的变量。a ?? b 的结果是 a，除非 a 为 null/undefined，这时结果是 b。

比较运算符

对不同类型的值进行相等检查时，运算符 == 会将不同类型的值转换为数字（除了 null 和 undefined，它们彼此相等而没有其他情况），所以下面的例子是相等的：

alert( 0 == false ); // true
alert( 0 == '' ); // true


其他比较也将转换为数字。
严格相等运算符 === 不会进行转换：不同的类型总是指不同的值。
值 null 和 undefined 是特殊的：它们只在 == 下相等，且不相等于其他任何值。
大于/小于比较，在比较字符串时，会按照字符顺序逐个字符地进行比较。其他类型则被转换为数字。

其他运算符

还有很少一部分其他运算符，如逗号运算符。

循环

我们涵盖了 3 种类型的循环：

// 1
while (condition) {
  ...
}

// 2
do {
  ...
} while (condition);

// 3
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  ...
}


在 for(let...) 循环内部声明的变量，只在该循环内可见。但我们也可以省略 let 并重用已有的变量。指令 break/continue 允许退出整个循环/当前迭代。使用标签来打破嵌套循环。

“switch” 结构

“switch” 结构可以替代多个 if 检查。它内部使用 ===（严格相等）进行比较。
例如：

let age = prompt('Your age?', 18);

switch (age) {
  case 18:
    alert("Won't work"); // prompt 的结果是一个字符串，而不是数字
    break;

  case "18":
    alert("This works!");
    break;

  default:
    alert("Any value not equal to one above");
}


函数

函数表达式 vs 函数声明

函数声明：在主代码流中声明为单独的语句的函数：

// 函数声明
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}


函数表达式：在一个表达式中或另一个语法结构中创建的函数。下面这个函数是在赋值表达式 = 右侧创建的：

// 函数表达式
let sum = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};


更细微的差别是，JavaScript 引擎会在 什么时候 创建函数。
函数表达式是在代码执行到达时被创建，并且仅从那一刻起可用。
一旦代码执行到赋值表达式 let sum = function… 的右侧，此时就会开始创建该函数，并且可以从现在开始使用（分配，调用等）。

函数声明则不同。
在函数声明被定义之前，它就可以被调用。
例如，一个全局函数声明对整个脚本来说都是可见的，无论它被写在这个脚本的哪个位置。
这是内部算法的缘故。当 JavaScript 准备 运行脚本时，首先会在脚本中寻找全局函数声明，并创建这些函数。我们可以将其视为“初始化阶段”。
在处理完所有函数声明后，代码才被执行。所以运行时能够使用这些函数。

例如下面的代码会正常工作：

sayHi("John"); // Hello, John

function sayHi(name) {
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
}


函数声明 sayHi 是在 JavaScript 准备运行脚本时被创建的，在这个脚本的任何位置都可见。

……如果它是一个函数表达式，它就不会工作：

sayHi("John"); // error!

let sayHi = function(name) {  // (*) no magic any more
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
};


函数表达式在代码执行到它时才会被创建。只会发生在 (*) 行。为时已晚。

函数声明的另外一个特殊的功能是它们的块级作用域。
严格模式下，当一个函数声明在一个代码块内时，它在该代码块内的任何位置都是可见的。但在代码块外不可见。
例如，想象一下我们需要依赖于在代码运行过程中获得的变量 age 声明一个函数 welcome()。并且我们计划在之后的某个时间使用它。
如果我们使用函数声明，则以下代码无法像预期那样工作：

let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

// 有条件地声明一个函数
if (age < 18) {

  function welcome() {
    alert("Hello!");
  }

} else {

  function welcome() {
    alert("Greetings!");
  }

}

// ……稍后使用
welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined


这是因为函数声明只在它所在的代码块中可见。
下面是另一个例子：

let age = 16; // 拿 16 作为例子

if (age < 18) {
  welcome();               // \   (运行)
                           //  |
  function welcome() {     //  |
    alert("Hello!");       //  |  函数声明在声明它的代码块内任意位置都可用
  }                        //  |
                           //  |
  welcome();               // /   (运行)

} else {

  function welcome() {
    alert("Greetings!");
  }
}

// 在这里，我们在花括号外部调用函数，我们看不到它们内部的函数声明。


welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined


我们怎么才能让 welcome 在 if 外可见呢？
正确的做法是使用函数表达式，并将 welcome 赋值给在 if 外声明的变量，并具有正确的可见性。
下面的代码可以如愿运行：

let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome;

if (age < 18) {

  welcome = function() {
    alert("Hello!");
  };

} else {

  welcome = function() {
    alert("Greetings!");
  };

}

welcome(); // 现在可以了


或者我们可以使用问号运算符 ? 来进一步对代码进行简化：

let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = (age < 18) ?
  function() { alert("Hello!"); } :
  function() { alert("Greetings!"); };

welcome(); // 现在可以了


什么时候选择函数声明与函数表达式？

根据经验，当我们需要声明一个函数时，首先考虑函数声明语法。它能够为组织代码提供更多的灵活性。因为我们可以在声明这些函数之前调用这些函数。
这对代码可读性也更好，因为在代码中查找 function f(…) {…} 比 let f = function(…) {…} 更容易。函数声明更“醒目”。
……但是，如果由于某种原因而导致函数声明不适合我们（我们刚刚看过上面的例子），那么应该使用函数表达式。

箭头函数

创建函数还有另外一种非常简单的语法，并且这种方法通常比函数表达式更好。
它被称为“箭头函数”，因为它看起来像这样：

let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;


这里创建了一个函数 func，它接受参数 arg1..argN，然后使用参数对右侧的 expression 求值并返回其结果。
换句话说，它是下面这段代码的更短的版本：

let func = function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) {
    return expression;
};


让我们来看一个具体的例子：

let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

/* 这个箭头函数是下面这个函数的更短的版本：

let sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
*/

alert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3


可以看到 (a, b) => a + b 表示一个函数接受两个名为 a 和 b 的参数。在执行时，它将对表达式 a + b 求值，并返回计算结果。

如果我们只有一个参数，还可以省略掉参数外的圆括号，使代码更短。例如：

let double = n => n * 2;// 差不多等同于：let double = function(n) { return n * 2 }

alert( double(3) ); // 6


如果没有参数，括号则是空的（但括号必须保留）：

let sayHi = () => alert("Hello!");
sayHi();


箭头函数可以像函数表达式一样使用。
例如，动态创建一个函数：

let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = (age < 18) ?
  () => alert('Hello!') :
  () => alert("Greetings!");

welcome();


一开始，箭头函数可能看起来并不熟悉，也不容易读懂，但一旦我们看习惯了之后，这种情况很快就会改变。
箭头函数对于简单的单行行为（action）来说非常方便，尤其是当我们懒得打太多字的时候。

多行的箭头函数

到目前为止，我们看到的箭头函数非常简单。它们从 => 的左侧获取参数，计算并返回右侧表达式的计算结果。
有时我们需要更复杂一点的函数，比如带有多行的表达式或语句。在这种情况下，我们可以使用花括号将它们括起来。主要区别在于，用花括号括起来之后，需要包含 return 才能返回值（就像常规函数一样）。
就像这样：

let sum = (a, b) => {  // 花括号表示开始一个多行函数
  let result = a + b;
  return result; // 如果我们使用了花括号，那么我们需要一个显式的 “return”
};

alert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3


作用域

// 全局作用域
let globalVar = "我是全局变量";

function test() {
  // 函数作用域
  let localVar = "我是局部变量";
  console.log(globalVar);  // ✅ 可以访问
  console.log(localVar);   // ✅ 可以访问
}

test();
console.log(globalVar);  // ✅ 可以访问
// console.log(localVar);  // ❌ 报错！

// 块级作用域
if (true) {
  let blockVar = "块级变量";
  console.log(blockVar);  // ✅
}
// console.log(blockVar);  // ❌ 报错！


对象

什么是对象？

对象是键值对的集合，用于存储和组织相关的数据和功能。

// 创建对象的几种方式

//1. 对象字面量（最常用）
const person = {
  name: "张三",
  age: 25,
  city: "北京"
};

// 2. 使用 new Object()
const car = new Object();
car.brand = "Tesla";
car.model = "Model 3";

// 3. 使用构造函数
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
const user = new Person("李四", 30);

// 4. 使用 Object.create()
const proto = { greeting: "Hello" };
const obj = Object.create(proto);


访问对象属性

const student = {
  name: "小明",
  age: 18,
  "favorite color": "blue"  // 带空格的属性名
};

// 点表示法
console.log(student.name);  // "小明"

// 方括号表示法
console.log(student["age"]);  // 18
console.log(student["favorite color"]);  // "blue"

// 动态访问
const key = "name";
console.log(student[key]);  // "小明"


对象的常用操作

const book = {
  title: "JavaScript 权威指南",
  author: "David Flanagan",
  year: 2020
};

// 添加/修改属性
book.pages = 1096;
book.year = 2021;

// 删除属性
delete book.year;

// 检查属性是否存在
console.log("title" in book);  // true
console.log(book.hasOwnProperty("author"));  // true

// 遍历对象
for (let key in book) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${book[key]}`);
}

// 获取所有键
console.log(Object.keys(book));  // ["title", "author", "pages"]

// 获取所有值
console.log(Object.values(book));  // ["JavaScript 权威指南", "David Flanagan", 1096]

// 获取键值对数组
console.log(Object.entries(book));  
// [["title", "JavaScript 权威指南"], ["author", "David Flanagan"], ["pages", 1096]


类

基本语法

class MyClass {
  // class 方法
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}


然后使用 new MyClass() 来创建具有上述列出的所有方法的新对象。
new 会自动调用 constructor() 方法，因此我们可以在 constructor() 中初始化对象。
例如：

class User {

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  sayHi() {
    alert(this.name);
  }

}

// 用法：
let user = new User("John");
user.sayHi();


当 new User("John") 被调用：

一个新对象被创建。constructor 使用给定的参数运行，并将其赋值给 this.name。
……然后我们就可以调用对象方法了，例如 user.sayHi。

什么是 class

class User {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }
  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }
}

// class 是一个函数
alert(typeof User); // function

// ...或者，更确切地说，是 constructor 方法
alert(User === User.prototype.constructor); // true

// 方法在 User.prototype 中，例如：
alert(User.prototype.sayHi); // sayHi 方法的代码

// 在原型中实际上有两个方法
alert(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(User.prototype)); // constructor, sayHi


class User {...} 构造实际上做了如下的事儿：

创建一个名为 User 的函数，该函数成为类声明的结果。该函数的代码来自于 constructor 方法（如果我们不编写这种方法，那么它就被假定为空）。存储类中的方法，例如 User.prototype 中的 sayHi。

类表达式

// “命名类表达式（Named Class Expression）”
// (规范中没有这样的术语，但是它和命名函数表达式类似)
let User = class MyClass {
  sayHi() {
    alert(MyClass); // MyClass 这个名字仅在类内部可见
  }
};

new User().sayHi(); // 正常运行，显示 MyClass 中定义的内容

alert(MyClass); // error，MyClass 在外部不可见


getter 和 setter

class User {

  constructor(name) {
    // 调用 setter
    this.name = name;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(value) {
    if (value.length < 4) {
      alert("Name is too short.");
      return;
    }
    this._name = value;
  }

}

let user = new User("John");
alert(user.name); // John

user = new User(""); // Name is too short.


类声明可以通过在 User.prototype 中创建 getters 和 setters 来实现。

面向对象

简单类比

// 把"人"这个概念变成代码中的对象

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;  // 属性：名字
    this.age = age;    // 属性：年龄
  }
  
  // 方法：说话
  speak(message) {
    console.log(`${this.name} 说: ${message}`);
  }
  
  // 方法：自我介绍
  introduce() {
    console.log(`大家好，我是 ${this.name}，今年 ${this.age} 岁`);
  }
}

// 创建具体的人（对象）
const xm = new Person('xm', 20);
xm.introduce();  // 大家好，我是 xm，今年 20 岁
xm.speak('你好！'); // xm 说: 你好！


核心概念

封装

把数据和方法包在一起，隐藏细节

class Phone {
  #battery = 100;  // 私有属性，外部看不到
  
  useBattery() {
    this.#battery -= 10;
    console.log(`剩余电量: ${this.#battery}%`);
  }
}

const myPhone = new Phone();
myPhone.useBattery();  // 剩余电量: 90%
// myPhone.#battery = 100;  // ❌ 错误！无法直接修改


继承

子类继承父类的属性和方法

// 父类
class Animal {
  eat() {
    console.log('正在吃东西...');
  }
}

// 子类继承父类
class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log('汪汪汪！');
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.eat();   // 正在吃东西... (继承自父类)
dog.bark();  // 汪汪汪！(自己的方法)


多态

同一个方法，不同对象有不同表现

class Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log('动物发出声音');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log('汪汪汪！');
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log('喵喵喵！');
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

dog.makeSound();  // 汪汪汪！
cat.makeSound();  // 喵喵喵！(同一个方法，不同表现)


为什么要用面向对象

let dog1Name = '旺财';
let dog1Age = 3;

let dog2Name = '大黄';
let dog2Age = 5;

function dog1Bark() {
  console.log(`${dog1Name} 在叫`);
}

function dog2Bark() {
  console.log(`${dog2Name} 在叫`);
}
class Dog {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  
  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} 在叫`);
  }
}

const dog1 = new Dog('旺财', 3);
const dog2 = new Dog('大黄', 5);

dog1.bark();  // 旺财 在叫
dog2.bark();  // 大黄 在叫


认识浏览器 API

浏览器 API（Browser APIs）是由浏览器提供的一组接口和功能，允许 JavaScript 代码与浏览器和用户的计算机进行交互。这些 API 让网页应用能够访问系统资源、处理用户交互等。

DOM （文档对象模型）

选择元素

// 1. 通过 ID 选择（返回单个元素）
const header = document.getElementById('header');

// 2. 通过类名选择（返回 HTMLCollection）
const items = document.getElementsByClassName('item');

// 3. 通过标签名选择（返回 HTMLCollection）
const divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');

// 4. 通过 CSS 选择器（返回第一个匹配元素）
const firstBtn = document.querySelector('.btn');
const mainTitle = document.querySelector('#main-title');
const firstPara = document.querySelector('p');

// 5. 通过 CSS 选择器（返回所有匹配元素的 NodeList）
const allBtns = document.querySelectorAll('.btn');
const allParas = document.querySelectorAll('p');

// 6. 特殊选择
document.body;           // 获取 body 元素
document.head;           // 获取 head 元素
document.documentElement; // 获取 html 元素


推荐使用： querySelector 和 querySelectorAll（更灵活强大）

操作元素内容

const div = document.querySelector('#myDiv');

// 1. textContent - 纯文本内容
div.textContent = '这是纯文本';
console.log(div.textContent);

// 2. innerHTML - HTML 内容
div.innerHTML = '<strong>这是粗体文本</strong>';
console.log(div.innerHTML);

// 3. innerText - 可见文本（考虑 CSS 样式）
div.innerText = '可见文本';

// 示例：
const example = document.querySelector('#example');
example.innerHTML = `
  <h2>标题</h2>
  <p>段落内容</p>
  <ul>
    <li>项目 1</li>
    <li>项目 2</li>
  </ul>
`;


操作元素属性

const img = document.querySelector('img');
const link = document.querySelector('a');

// 1. 获取/设置标准属性
img.src = 'new-image.jpg';
img.alt = '图片描述';
console.log(img.src);

link.href = 'https://example.com';
link.target = '_blank';

// 2. getAttribute / setAttribute（适用于所有属性）
const customValue = img.getAttribute('data-id');
img.setAttribute('data-id', '123');

// 3. 移除属性
img.removeAttribute('alt');

// 4. 检查属性是否存在
if (img.hasAttribute('src')) {
  console.log('图片有 src 属性');
}

// 5. data-* 属性（HTML5 自定义属性）
// HTML: <div data-user-id="123" data-role="admin"></div>
const div = document.querySelector('div');
console.log(div.dataset.userId);  // "123"
console.log(div.dataset.role);    // "admin"
div.dataset.newAttr = 'value';    // 设置 data-new-attr="value"


操作 css 样式

const box = document.querySelector('.box');

// 1. 直接修改行内样式
box.style.color = 'red';
box.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';  // 注意：CSS 的 background-color 变成驼峰命名
box.style.fontSize = '20px';
box.style.width = '300px';

// 2. 设置多个样式
Object.assign(box.style, {
  color: 'white',
  backgroundColor: 'black',
  padding: '20px',
  borderRadius: '10px'
});

// 3. 使用 cssText（一次性设置多个）
box.style.cssText = 'color: red; background: blue; font-size: 20px;';

// 4. 获取计算后的样式
const styles = window.getComputedStyle(box);
console.log(styles.color);
console.log(styles.fontSize);

// 5. 操作 class（推荐方法）
box.classList.add('active');           // 添加类
box.classList.remove('hidden');        // 移除类
box.classList.toggle('highlight');     // 切换类（有则删，无则加）
box.classList.contains('active');      // 检查是否有某个类
box.classList.replace('old', 'new');   // 替换类

// 老方法（不推荐）
box.className = 'box active';          // 直接设置（会覆盖）
box.className += ' new-class';         // 添加类


创建和插入元素

// 1. 创建元素
const div = document.createElement('div');
const p = document.createElement('p');
const span = document.createElement('span');

// 2. 设置内容和属性
div.textContent = '这是新创建的 div';
div.className = 'new-div';
div.id = 'myDiv';

// 3. 插入元素
const container = document.querySelector('#container');

// appendChild - 添加到末尾
container.appendChild(div);

// insertBefore - 插入到指定元素前面
const firstChild = container.firstElementChild;
container.insertBefore(p, firstChild);

// append / prepend（可以插入多个，包括文本）
container.append(span, '文本内容');    // 添加到末尾
container.prepend('开头的文本', p);    // 添加到开头

// after / before - 在元素前后插入
div.before('前面的内容');
div.after('后面的内容');

// insertAdjacentHTML - 插入 HTML 字符串
container.insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin', '<p>在元素前</p>');
container.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', '<p>在内容开头</p>');
container.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', '<p>在内容末尾</p>');
container.insertAdjacentHTML('afterend', '<p>在元素后</p>');

// 4. 完整示例：创建一个列表
const ul = document.createElement('ul');
const items = ['苹果', '香蕉', '橙子'];

items.forEach(item => {
  const li = document.createElement('li');
  li.textContent = item;
  ul.appendChild(li);
});

document.body.appendChild(ul);


删除和替换元素

const element = document.querySelector('#myElement');
const parent = document.querySelector('#parent');

// 1. 删除元素
element.remove();  // 直接删除自己（现代方法）
parent.removeChild(element);  // 通过父元素删除（老方法）

// 2. 替换元素
const newElement = document.createElement('div');
newElement.textContent = '新元素';
element.replaceWith(newElement);  // 直接替换（现代方法）
parent.replaceChild(newElement, element);  // 通过父元素替换（老方法）

// 3. 清空元素内容
parent.innerHTML = '';  // 方法 1
while (parent.firstChild) {  // 方法 2（更安全）
  parent.removeChild(parent.firstChild);
}


BOM（浏览器对象模型）

用于与浏览器窗口交互

// 窗口对象
window.alert('提示')
window.confirm('确认?')
window.location.href = 'https://example.com'

// 定时器
setTimeout(() => { console.log('延迟执行') }, 1000)
setInterval(() => { console.log('循环执行') }, 1000)

// 浏览器历史
window.history.back()
window.history.forward()


事件

处理用户交互事件

const button = document.querySelector('#myButton');

// 1. addEventListener（推荐）
button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  console.log('按钮被点击了');
  console.log('事件对象：', event);
});

// 2. 使用箭头函数
button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  console.log('点击', event.target);
});

// 3. 命名函数（便于移除）
function handleClick(event) {
  console.log('处理点击');
}
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);

// 移除事件监听器
button.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);

// 4. 老方法（不推荐，会覆盖之前的）
button.onclick = function() {
  console.log('点击');
};

// 5. HTML 属性（不推荐）
// <button onclick="handleClick()">点击</button>
