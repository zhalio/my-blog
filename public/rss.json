            "content_html": "一、 实现逻辑\n\n扩容原理：使用 parted 修改分区表，删除旧分区（Server, Data, Cache 等），按新大小重建分区。\n救砖实现：https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=3pP4nYaj2aY&themeRefresh=1\n\n用sp-flash-tool刷preloader，用mtkclient刷需要刷入的bin\n\n二、 准备工作\n\n环境：电脑已配置 ADB/Fastboot 驱动，手机能进入 TWRP 或 Fastboot。\n工具：\nadb工具包\nparted 二进制文件（用于手机端分区）。\n文件：\nsystem.img (原厂或 GSI 系统镜像)。\nvbmeta.img (必须去验证，否则不开机)。\n(可选) boot.img (如果 GSI 需要特定内核)。\n\n三、 步骤 1：分区扩容 (在 TWRP 下操作)\n\n手机进入 TWRP，连接电脑，推送工具并进入环境。\n\nadb push parted /tmp/               # 推送工具\nadb shell chmod 755 /tmp/parted     # 给权限\nadb shell /tmp/parted /dev/block/mmcblk0 # 运行工具\n\n\n在 parted 交互界面操作\n(以下数值基于 3GB System 扩容方案，严格按顺序执行)\n\n(parted) unit mb                    # 切换单位\n(parted) print                      # 确认 vendor 结束于 923MB\n\n# 删除旧分区\n(parted) rm 34                      # userdata\n(parted) rm 33                      # cache\n(parted) rm 32                      # vbmeta\n(parted) rm 31                      # system\n\n# 重建分区 (System 扩容至 3GB)\n(parted) mkpart system ext2 923 4000\n(parted) mkpart vbmeta 4000 4016\n(parted) mkpart cache ext4 4016 4500\n(parted) mkpart userdata ext4 4500 15572\n\n# 命名分区\n(parted) name 31 system\n(parted) name 32 vbmeta\n(parted) name 33 cache\n(parted) name 34 userdata\n\n(parted) quit                       # 退出\n\n\n重启到 Fastboot\n退出 parted 后，立刻重启到 Bootloader，不要重启系统！！！！！本机只能通过twrp进fastboot，如果重新启动，进不了twrp也就无法进fastboot了\n\nadb reboot bootloader\n\n\n四、 步骤 2：刷写系统 (在 Fastboot 下操作)\n\n刷入基础镜像\n\n# 刷入系统 (忽略大小不匹配警告)\nfastboot flash system System.img\n\n# 刷入去验证的 Vbmeta (防止卡米的关键)\nfastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta vbmeta.img\n# 如果报错 unknown option，尝试直接刷：fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta.img\n\n\n重建文件系统 (必须做！)\n扩容后这两个分区是“未格式化”状态，必须擦除重建。\n\nfastboot erase userdata\nfastboot erase cache\n# 如果 fastboot 版本较老不支持 format，erase 也足够触发安卓自动格式化\n\n\n重启\n\nfastboot reboot\n\n\n五、 GSI 系统选择\n\n架构: arm32_binder64 (也叫 a64)\n文件名示例: system-a64-bvN.img (b=A/B型, v=纯净版, N=无Root)\n\n六、更换别的GSI\n\nREM 擦除旧系统\nfastboot erase system\n\nREM 刷入新 GSI \nfastboot flash system <你的GSI镜像文件路径.img>\n\nREM 再次清除数据 (换系统必须双清，否则卡开机动画)\nfastboot erase userdata\nfastboot format userdata\n\nREM 重启\nfastboot reboot\n\n",

            "content_html": "英汉翻译教程期末复习\n\n第一部分：简答题（翻译史与理论）\n\n第一章 翻译史简介\n\n1. 我国翻译事业的历史有多久？谁是我国古代佛经三大翻译家？\n\n历史时长：我国翻译事业有约两千年的光辉历史。\n依据：起源于西汉哀帝时期伊存口传佛经，但正式的翻译活动始于东汉桓帝建和二年（公元184年）安世高译经。古代佛经三大翻译家：\n鸠摩罗什 (Kumarajiva) —— 后秦时期真谛 (Paramartha) —— 南朝梁/陈时期玄奘 (Xuanzang) —— 唐代\n\n2. 玄奘对我国翻译事业有些什么贡献？\n玄奘的贡献是巨大的，主要体现在以下几个方面：\n\n数量与质量双高：他在十九年间译出佛经75部，共1335卷。其译文质量极高，在组织制度方面比过去更健全。文化交流（双向翻译）：他不仅把大量梵文佛经译成汉文，还把老子的著作（《道德经》）的一部分译成梵文，是第一个把汉文著作向国外介绍的中国人。翻译理论：他提出了著名的翻译标准 “既须求真，又须喻俗”。\n解释：“求真”即忠实于原文，“喻俗”即译文要通顺通俗，让百姓能懂。这也就是后世所说的“忠实、通顺”。建立了完备的译场：玄奘主持的译场分工明确，程序严谨，标志着中国古代翻译事业的高度成熟。\n\n3. 如何理解严复的“信、达、雅”翻译标准？\n严复在《天演论》卷首的《译例言》中提出了“译事三难：信、达、雅”。\n\n原始含义：\n信 (Faithfulness)：意义不倍（背）本文，即忠实于原文的内容和意义。达 (Expressiveness)：不拘泥于原文形式，尽译文语言的能事以求原意明显，即通顺流畅。雅 (Elegance)：（这是争议点）严复当时主张的“雅”是指脱离原文而片面追求译文本身的“古雅”，即使用“汉以前字法句法”（上等的文言文）。原文评价与现代理解：\n原文指出：严复对“雅”的解释（追求古文言）在今天看来是不足取的，因为这会导致译文艰深难懂，甚至不忠实于原文（类似改编）。补充理解：现代翻译界虽然仍沿用这三个字，但赋予了新的内容。现在的“雅”不再指用古文，而是指 “保存原作的风格”（Style），即译文要有文采，符合目标语的审美规范。\n\n4. “五四”时期翻译工作的特点是什么？\n“五四”是我国近代翻译史的分水岭，其主要特点包括：\n\n内容上的转变：从翻译资产阶级学术名著，转向介绍马列主义经典著作和无产阶级文学作品（如《共产党宣言》的翻译）。形式上的变革：白话文代替了文言文。这是最显著的表现，使翻译作品更加普及，更有利于思想的传播。文化影响：东西方各国优秀文学作品（特别是俄国和苏联作品）被大量介绍进来，鲁迅、瞿秋白等是这一时期的卓越先驱。\n\n5. 鲁迅、瞿秋白对翻译工作提出了有些什么看法？\n鲁迅和瞿秋白极其重视翻译，主要观点如下：\n\n鲁迅的“宁信而不顺”：\n鲁迅针对当时胡乱翻译（“胡译”、“乱译”）和为了通顺而随意篡改原文的现象，提出了 “宁信而不顺” 的原则。注意：这不是说不要通顺，而是在“信”与“顺”不可兼得时，宁可保留原文的语法结构和异国情调（洋气），以输入新的表达方式来丰富汉语，也不要为了讨好读者的阅读习惯而牺牲原文的真实性。兼顾两面：鲁迅认为翻译必须兼顾两面：一当然力求其易解，一则保存着原作的丰姿。反对“硬译”与“死译”：虽然鲁迅主张直译，但他和瞿秋白都反对把直译变成让人看不懂的“死译”，他们主张的是在保持原作风貌基础上的直译。\n\n6. 新中国成立后的翻译工作有哪些特点？\n1949年新中国成立后，翻译工作进入了新阶段：\n\n有组织、有计划：改变了过去抢译、乱译和重复浪费的现象，翻译工作在党的领导下系统进行。质量提高：逐渐克服了粗枝大叶、不负责任的现象，译文质量大大提高。服务目的明确：翻译工作更好地为社会主义建设服务。任务双向化：翻译工作者不仅肩负着“外译汉”（介绍外国科技、文化）的任务，还肩负了 “汉译外” 的任务（介绍我国社会主义革命经验和优秀文化遗产）。标准趋向统一：对翻译标准的认识日趋统一，有效地推动了翻译工作。\n\n7. 为什么翻译工作者需要知道一些我国翻译史？\n\n总结经验，批判吸收：约两千年的翻译历史积累了一份宝贵的文化遗产。我们需要认真总结前人的翻译经验，批判地吸收前人从实践中总结出来的理论、方法。继往开来：只有了解历史，才能继承优良传统，继续提高我们的翻译水平，发展翻译事业。简言之，就是“以史为鉴，指导实践”。\n\n8. 当前我国翻译事业有哪些问题值得思考？\n\n量与质的矛盾：随着翻译事业繁荣，客观上翻译需求成倍增长，但合格的翻译人才供不应求。水平参差不齐：翻译水平差距较大，市场上出现了一些质量低劣的翻译作品。人才培养迫切：翻译人才的培养亟待加强，以解决供需矛盾和质量问题。\n\n\n\n第二部分：词义选择与引申\n\n一、like 一词多义翻译示例\n\nHe likes mathematics more than physics.\n他喜欢数学甚于喜欢物理学。In the sunbeam passing through the window there are fine grains of dust shining like gold.\n在射入窗内的阳光里，细微的尘埃像金子一般在闪闪发亮。Like knows like.\n英雄识英雄。\n\n二、last 形容词不同语境翻译示例\n\nHe is the last man to come.\n他是最后来的。He is the last man to do it.\n他决不会干那件事。He is the last person for such a job.\n他最不配干这个工作。He should be the last (man) to blame.\n怎么也不该怪他。He is the last man to consult.\n根本不宜找他商量。This is the last place where I expected to meet you.\n我怎么也没料到会在这个地方见到你。\n\n三、take (off) 动词翻译示例\n\nTo take off her boots or to put them on was an agony to her, and it had been an agony for years.\n脱鞋或穿鞋对她是一种痛苦，但这已是多年以来的痛苦了。An area the size of the Hornet’s flight deck was marked off on an airstrip and they practiced taking off time after time from this restricted space.\n在机场上标出了与大黄蜂号甲板一样大小的一块地方，他们（机组人员）一次又一次地练习从这样一块有限的面积上起飞。He always sits on the very edge of his chair when he is working, as though about to take off.\n他工作的时候，总是坐在椅子边上，好像随时都会跳起身来的样子。Their first major design was a pleated denim jean with external pockets dubbed “baggies” that took off in high schools and colleges and soon was imitated by other apparel manufacturers.\n他们的头一项重要设计是一种打褶的、缝上明袋的蓝色斜纹粗布裤，这种裤子人们称为“袋子”，在中学和大学中首先流行，接着别的服装制造商也都很快仿制起来。\n\n四、词义抽象化引申翻译示例\n\nThere is a mixture of the tiger and the ape in the character of the imperialists.\n帝国主义者的性格既残暴，又狡猾。Every life has its roses and thorns.\n每个人的生活都有甜有苦。In fact, the Bavarian environment was so charged with Nazi sentiment throughout the 1920s that Hitler’s storm troops goosestepped into power in Furth in 1930...\n事实上，在整个二十世纪二十年代，纳粹党在巴伐利亚一带已博得公众好感，以至于在一九三〇年，希特勒的冲锋队员就耀武扬威地夺取了菲尔特镇的权力。See-sawing between partly good and faintly ominous, the news for the next four weeks was never distinct.\n在那以后的四个星期内，消息时而部分有所好转，时而又有点不妙，两种情况不断地交替出现，一直没有明朗化。As the Politburo gave the go-ahead to Brezhnev, Nixon and Kissinger were meeting in the President’s Kremlin apartment, prepared to accept a setback on SALT.\n在政治局向勃列日涅夫开放绿灯时，尼克松和基辛格正在克里姆林宫的总统下榻处开会，准备承受限制战略武器会谈失败的挫折。Vietnam was his entrée to the new Administration, his third incarnation as a foreign policy consultant.\n越南战争成了他进入新政府的敲门砖。他担任政府的对外政策顾问，那是第三次了。The car in front of me stalled and I missed the green.\n我前头的那辆车停住了，我错过了绿灯。Jewish-owned shops were shut down. Swastikas replaced six-pointed stars. The walls of anti-Semitism were closing in.\n犹太人的铺子关闭了。卐字旗取代了六角星旗。反犹太主义的包围圈一天紧似一天。\n\n五、词义褒贬翻译示例\n\nHe was a man of high renown (fame).\n他是位有名望的人。（褒）His notoriety as a rake did not come until his death.\n他作为流氓的恶名是他死后才传开来的。（贬）The tasks carried out by them are praiseworthy.\n他们进行的事业是值得赞扬的。（褒）Henry keeps boasting that he has talked to the President.\n亨利总是吹嘘说他曾同总统谈过话。（贬）“He was polite and always gave advice willingly,” she recalled.\n她回忆说：“他彬彬有礼，总是诲人不倦。”（褒）We were shocked by his coarse manners.\n我们对他的粗暴态度感到震惊。（贬）Once, early in 1974, while driving along the San Diego Freeway from Clemente to Los Angeles, he was asked to reflect on his hopes and ambitions.\n一九七四年初，有人同他一起驱车从克利门蒂沿圣地亚哥公路去洛杉矶，途中请他谈了他的希望和抱负。“After all,” counseled Sonnenfeldt, “you’re the only Republican I know with the proper academic credentials.” Kissinger demurred. Such an offer, he said, was highly unlikely.\n索南费尔特劝他说：“共和党里我知道只有你一个人具有这样的学术资历。”基辛格免不了谦虚一番，说恐怕不大可能给他这样的职位吧。The two politicians talked for no more than five minutes, at a significant moment in their careers.\n两位政治家交谈了仅仅五分钟。这次谈话是在他们一生事业的重大时刻进行的。He was a man of integrity, but unfortunately he had a certain reputation.

            "content_html": "JavaScript 简介\n\n什么是 JavaScript？\n\nJavaScript 最初被创建的目的是“使网页更生动”。\n这种编程语言写出来的程序被称为 脚本。它们可以被直接写在网页的 HTML 中，在页面加载的时候自动执行。\n脚本被以纯文本的形式提供和执行。它们不需要特殊的准备或编译即可运行。\n这方面，JavaScript 和 Java 有很大的区别。\n\n为什么叫 JavaScript？\n\nJavaScript 在刚诞生的时候，它的名字叫 “LiveScript”。但是因为当时 Java 很流行，所以决定将一种新语言定位为 Java 的“弟弟”会有助于它的流行。\n随着 JavaScript 的发展，它已经成为了一门完全独立的语言，并且也拥有了自己的语言规范 ECMAScript。现在，它和 Java 之间没有任何关系。\n\n如今，JavaScript 不仅可以在浏览器中执行，也可以在服务端执行，甚至可以在任意搭载了 JavaScript 引擎 的设备中执行。\n浏览器中嵌入了 JavaScript 引擎，有时也称作“JavaScript 虚拟机”。\n不同的引擎有不同的“代号”，例如：\n\nV8 —— Chrome、Opera 和 Edge 中的 JavaScript 引擎。SpiderMonkey —— Firefox 中的 JavaScript 引擎。……还有其他一些代号，像 “Chakra” 用于 IE，“JavaScriptCore”、“Nitro” 和 “SquirrelFish” 用于 Safari，等等。\n\n上面这些术语很容易记住，因为它们经常出现在开发者的文章中。我们也会用到这些术语。例如，如果“V8 支持某个功能”，那么我们可以认为这个功能大概能在 Chrome、Opera 和 Edge 中正常运行。\n\n引擎是如何工作的？\n\n引擎很复杂，但是基本原理很简单。\n\n引擎（如果是浏览器，则引擎被嵌入在其中）读取（“解析”）脚本。然后，引擎将脚本转化（“编译”）为机器语言。然后，机器代码快速地执行。\n\n引擎会对流程中的每个阶段都进行优化。它甚至可以在编译的脚本运行时监视它，分析流经该脚本的数据，并根据获得的信息进一步优化机器代码。\n\n浏览器中的 JavaScript 能做什么？\n\n现代的 JavaScript 是一种“安全的”编程语言。它不提供对内存或 CPU 的底层访问，因为它最初是为浏览器创建的，不需要这些功能。\nJavaScript 的能力很大程度上取决于它运行的环境。例如，Node.js 支持允许 JavaScript 读取/写入任意文件，执行网络请求等的函数。\n浏览器中的 JavaScript 可以做与网页操作、用户交互和 Web 服务器相关的所有事情。\n\n例如，浏览器中的 JavaScript 可以做下面这些事：\n\n在网页中添加新的 HTML，修改网页已有内容和网页的样式。响应用户的行为，响应鼠标的点击，指针的移动，按键的按动。向远程服务器发送网络请求，下载和上传文件（所谓的 AJAX 和 COMET 技术）。获取或设置 cookie，向访问者提出问题或发送消息。记住客户端的数据（“本地存储”）。\n\n浏览器中的 JavaScript 不能做什么？\n\n为了用户的（信息）安全，在浏览器中的 JavaScript 的能力是受限的。目的是防止恶意网页获取用户私人信息或损害用户数据。\n此类限制的例子包括：\n\n网页中的 JavaScript 不能读、写、复制和执行硬盘上的任意文件。它没有直接访问操作系统的功能。现代浏览器允许 JavaScript 做一些文件相关的操作，但是这个操作是受到限制的。仅当用户做出特定的行为，JavaScript 才能操作这个文件。例如，用户把文件“拖放”到浏览器中，或者通过 <input> 标签选择了文件。有很多与相机/麦克风和其它设备进行交互的方式，但是这些都需要获得用户的明确许可。因此，启用了 JavaScript 的网页应该不会偷偷地启动网络摄像头观察你，并把你的信息发送到 美国国家安全局。不同的标签页/窗口之间通常互不了解。有时候，也会有一些联系，例如一个标签页通过 JavaScript 打开的另外一个标签页。但即使在这种情况下，如果两个标签页打开的不是同一个网站（域名、协议或者端口任一不相同的网站），它们都不能相互通信。这就是所谓的“同源策略”。为了解决“同源策略”问题，两个标签页必须 都 包含一些处理这个问题的特定的 JavaScript 代码，并均允许数据交换。本教程会讲到这部分相关的知识。这个限制也是为了用户的信息安全。例如，用户打开的 https://www.google.com/ 网页必须不能访问 http://gmail.com（另外一个标签页打开的网页）也不能从那里窃取信息。JavaScript 可以轻松地通过互联网与当前页面所在的服务器进行通信。但是从其他网站/域的服务器中接收数据的能力被削弱了。尽管可以，但是需要来自远程服务器的明确协议（在 HTTP header 中）。这也是为了用户的信息安全。\n\n如果在浏览器环境外（例如在服务器上）使用 JavaScript，则不存在此类限制。现代浏览器还允许安装可能会要求扩展权限的插件/扩展。\n\n是什么使得 JavaScript 与众不同？\n\n至少有 3 件事值得一提：\n\n与 HTML/CSS 完全集成。简单的事，简单地完成。被所有的主流浏览器支持，并且默认开启。\n\nJavaScript 是将这三件事结合在一起的唯一的浏览器技术。\n这就是为什么 JavaScript 与众不同。这也是为什么它是用于创建浏览器界面的使用最广泛的工具。\n此外，JavaScript 还可用于创建服务器和移动端应用程序等。\n\nJavaScript “上层”语言\n\n不同的人想要不同的功能。JavaScript 的语法也不能满足所有人的需求。\n这是正常的，因为每个人的项目和需求都不一样。\n因此，最近出现了许多新语言，这些语言在浏览器中执行之前，都会被 编译（转化）成 JavaScript。\n现代化的工具使得编译速度非常快且透明，实际上允许开发者使用另一种语言编写代码并会将其“自动转换”为 JavaScript。\n\n此类语言的示例有：\n\nCoffeeScript 是 JavaScript 的一种语法糖。它引入了更加简短的语法，使我们可以编写更清晰简洁的代码。通常，Ruby 开发者喜欢它。TypeScript 专注于添加“严格的数据类型”以简化开发，以更好地支持复杂系统的开发。由微软开发。Flow 也添加了数据类型，但是以一种不同的方式。由 Facebook 开发。Dart 是一门独立的语言。它拥有自己的引擎，该引擎可以在非浏览器环境中运行（例如手机应用），它也可以被编译成 JavaScript。由 Google 开发。Brython 是一个 Python 到 JavaScript 的转译器，让我们可以在不使用 JavaScript 的情况下，以纯 Python 编写应用程序。Kotlin 是一个现代、简洁且安全的编程语言，编写出的应用程序可以在浏览器和 Node 环境中运行。\n\n这样的语言还有很多。当然，即使我们在使用此类编译语言，我们也需要了解 JavaScript。因为了解 JavaScript 才能让我们真正明白我们在做什么。\n\nJavaScript 入门\n\n“script” 标签\n\n我们几乎可以使用 <script> 标签将 JavaScript 程序插入到 HTML 文档的任何位置。\n比如：\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<body>\n  <p>script 标签之前...</p>\n  <script>alert('Hello, world!');</script>\n  <p>...script 标签之后</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n<script> 标签中包裹了 JavaScript 代码，当浏览器遇到 <script> 标签，代码会自动运行。\n\n外部脚本\n\n如果你有大量的 JavaScript 代码，我们可以将它放入一个单独的文件。\n脚本文件可以通过 src 特性添加到 HTML 文件中。\n\n<script src=\"/path/to/script.js\"></script>\n\n\n这里，/path/to/script.js 是脚本文件从网站根目录开始的绝对路径。当然也可以提供当前页面的相对路径。例如，src=\"script.js\"，就像 src=\"./script.js\"，表示当前文件夹中的 \"script.js\" 文件。\n\n我们也可以提供一个完整的 URL 地址，例如：\n\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js\"></script>\n\n\n要附加多个脚本，请使用多个标签：\n\n<script src=\"/js/script1.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/js/script2.js\"></script>\n\n\n…\n请注意：\n一般来说，只有最简单的脚本才嵌入到 HTML 中。更复杂的脚本存放在单独的文件中。\n使用独立文件的好处是浏览器会下载它，然后将它保存到浏览器的缓存中。\n之后，其他页面想要相同的脚本就会从缓存中获取，而不是下载它。所以文件实际上只会下载一次。\n这可以节省流量，并使得页面（加载）更快。\n\n如果设置了 src 特性，script 标签内容将会被忽略。\n一个单独的 <script> 标签不能同时有 src 特性和内部包裹的代码。\n这将不会工作：\n\n<script src=\"file.js\">\n    alert(1); // 此内容会被忽略，因为设定了 src\n</script>\n\n\n我们必须进行选择，要么使用外部的 <script src=\"…\">，要么使用正常包裹代码的 <script>。\n为了让上面的例子工作，我们可以将它分成两个 <script> 标签。\n\n<script src=\"file.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    alert(1);\n</script>\n\n\nJavaScript 特性\n\n代码结构\n\n语句用分号分隔：\n\nalert('Hello'); alert('World');\n\n\n通常，换行符也被视为分隔符，因此下面的例子也能正常运行：\n\nalert('Hello')\nalert('World')\n\n\n这就是所谓的「自动分号插入」。但有时它不起作用，例如：\n\nalert(\"There will be an error after this message\")\n[1, 2].forEach(alert)\n\n\n大多数代码风格指南都认为我们应该在每个语句后面都加上分号。\n在代码块 {...} 后以及有代码块的语法结构（例如循环）后不需要加分号：\n\nfunction f() {\n  // 函数声明后不需要加分号\n}\n\nfor(;;) {\n  // 循环语句后不需要加分号\n}\n\n\n……但即使我们在某处添加了「额外的」分号，这也不是错误。分号会被忽略的。\n\n严格模式\n\n为了完全启用现代 JavaScript 的所有特性，我们应该在脚本顶部写上 \"use strict\" 指令。\n\n'use strict';\n...\n\n\n该指令必须位于 JavaScript 脚本的顶部或函数体的开头。\n如果没有 \"use strict\"，所有东西仍可以正常工作，但某些功能将以老式的“兼容”方式运行。我们通常更喜欢现代的方式。\n\n变量\n\n可以使用以下方式声明变量：\n\nletconst（不变的，不能被改变）var（旧式的）\n\n一个变量名可以由以下组成：\n\n字母和数字，但是第一个字符不能是数字。字符 $ 和 _ 是允许的，用法同字母。非拉丁字母和象形文字也是允许的，但通常不会使用。\n\n变量是动态类型的，它们可以存储任何值：\n\nlet x = 5;\nx = \"John\";\n\n\n有 8 种数据类型：\n\nnumber — 可以是浮点数，也可以是整数，bigint — 用于任意长度的整数，string — 字符串类型，boolean — 逻辑值：true/false，null — 具有单个值 null 的类型，表示“空”或“不存在”，undefined — 具有单个值 undefined 的类型，表示“未分配（未定义）”，object 和 symbol — 对于复杂的数据结构和唯一标识符，我们目前还没学习这个类型。\n\ntypeof 运算符返回值的类型，但有两个例外：\n\ntypeof null == \"object\" // JavaScript 编程语言的设计错误\ntypeof function(){} == \"function\" // 函数被特殊对待\n\n\n交互\n\n我们使用浏览器作为工作环境，所以基本的 UI 功能将是：\n\nprompt(question[, default]) 提出一个问题 question，并返回访问者输入的内容，如果他按下「取消」则返回 null。confirm(question) 提出一个问题 question，并建议用户在“确定”和“取消”之间进行选择。选择结果以 true/false 形式返回。alert(message) 输出一个消息 message。\n\n这些函数都会产生 模态框，它们会暂停代码执行并阻止访问者与页面的其他部分进行交互，直到用户做出回答为止。\n举个例子：\n\nlet userName = prompt(\"Your name?\", \"Alice\");\nlet isTeaWanted = confirm(\"Do you want some tea?\");\n\nalert( \"Visitor: \" + userName ); // Alice\nalert( \"Tea wanted: \" + isTeaWanted ); // true\n\n\n运算符\n\nJavaScript 支持以下运算符：\n\n算数运算符\n\n常规的：+ - * /（加减乘除），取余运算符 % 和幂运算符 **。\n二进制加号 + 可以连接字符串。如果任何一个操作数是一个字符串，那么另一个操作数也将被转换为字符串：\n\nalert( '1' + 2 ); // '12'，字符串\nalert( 1 + '2' ); // '12'，字符串\nalert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // \"41\"，不是 \"221\"\nalert('1' + 2 + 2); // \"122\"，不是 \"14\"\n\n\n赋值\n\n简单的赋值：a = b 和合并了其他操作的赋值：a *= 2。\n\n按位运算符\n\n按位运算符在最低位级上操作 32 位的整数\n\n三元运算符\n\n唯一具有三个参数的操作：cond ? resultA : resultB。如果 cond 为真，则返回 resultA，否则返回 resultB。\n有时我们需要根据一个条件去赋值一个变量。\n如下所示：\n\nlet accessAllowed;\nlet age = prompt('How old are you?', '');\n\nif (age > 18) {\n  accessAllowed = true;\n} else {\n  accessAllowed = false;\n}\n\nalert(accessAllowed);\n\n\n所谓的“条件”或“问号”运算符让我们可以更简短地达到目的。\n这个运算符通过问号 ? 表示。有时它被称为三元运算符，被称为“三元”是因为该运算符中有三个操作数。实际上它是 JavaScript 中唯一一个有这么多操作数的运算符。\n语法：\n\nlet result = condition ? value1 : value2;\n\n\n计算条件结果，如果结果为真，则返回 value1，否则返回 value2。\n例如：\n\nlet accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;\n\n\n技术上讲，我们可以省略 age > 18 外面的括号。问号运算符的优先级较低，所以它会在比较运算符 > 后执行。\n下面这个示例会执行和前面那个示例相同的操作：\n\n// 比较运算符 \"age > 18\" 首先执行\n//（不需要将其包含在括号中）\nlet accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;\n\n\n但括号可以使代码可读性更强，所以我们建议使用它们。\n请注意：\n在上面的例子中，你可以不使用问号运算符，因为比较本身就返回 true/false：\n\n// 下面代码同样可以实现\nlet accessAllowed = age > 18;\n\n\n多个 ‘?’\n\n使用一系列问号 ? 运算符可以返回一个取决于多个条件的值。\n例如：\n\nlet age = prompt('age?', 18);\n\nlet message = (age < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :\n  (age < 18) ? 'Hello!' :\n  (age < 100) ? 'Greetings!' :\n  'What an unusual age!';\n\nalert( message );\n\n\n可能很难一下子看出发生了什么。但经过仔细观察，我们可以看到它只是一个普通的检查序列。\n\n第一个问号检查 age < 3。如果为真 — 返回 'Hi, baby!'。否则，会继续执行冒号 : 后的表达式，检查 age < 18。如果为真 — 返回 'Hello!'。否则，会继续执行下一个冒号 : 后的表达式，检查 age < 100。如果为真 — 返回 'Greetings!'。否则，会继续执行最后一个冒号 : 后面的表达式，返回 'What an unusual age!'。\n\n这是使用 if..else 实现上面的逻辑的写法：\n\nif (age < 3) {\n  message = 'Hi, baby!';\n} else if (age < 18) {\n  message = 'Hello!';\n} else if (age < 100) {\n  message = 'Greetings!';\n} else {\n  message = 'What an unusual age!';\n}\n\n\n‘?’ 的非常规使用\n\n有时可以使用问号 ? 来代替 if 语句：\n\nlet company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');\n\n(company == 'Netscape') ?alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');\n\n\n根据条件 company =='Netscape'，要么执行 ? 后面的第一个表达式并显示对应内容，要么执行第二个表达式并显示对应内容。\n在这里我们不是把结果赋值给变量。而是根据条件执行不同的代码。\n不建议这样使用问号运算符。\n这种写法比 if 语句更短，对一些程序员很有吸引力。但它的可读性差。\n下面是使用 if 语句实现相同功能的代码，进行下比较：\n\nlet company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');\n\nif (company == 'Netscape') {\n    alert('Right!');\n} else {\n    alert('Wrong.');\n}\n\n\n因为我们的眼睛垂直扫描代码。所以，跨越几行的代码块比长而水平的代码更易于理解。\n问号 ? 的作用是根据条件返回其中一个值。请正确使用它。当需要执行不同的代码分支时，请使用 if。\n\n逻辑运算符\n\n逻辑与 && 和或 || 执行短路运算，然后返回运算停止处的值（true/false 不是必须的）。逻辑非 ! 将操作数转换为布尔值并返回其相反的值。\n\n空值合并运算符\n\na ?? b 的结果是：\n\n如果 a 是已定义的，则结果为 a，如果 a 不是已定义的，则结果为 b。\n\n换句话说，如果第一个参数不是 null/undefined，则 ?? 返回第一个参数。否则，返回第二个参数。\n\nlet user;\n\nalert(user ?? \"匿名\"); // 匿名（user 未定义）\n\n\n?? 运算符从一列变量中，选取值为已定义的值（defined value）的变量。a ?? b 的结果是 a，除非 a 为 null/undefined，这时结果是 b。\n\n比较运算符\n\n对不同类型的值进行相等检查时，运算符 == 会将不同类型的值转换为数字（除了 null 和 undefined，它们彼此相等而没有其他情况），所以下面的例子是相等的：\n\nalert( 0 == false ); // true\nalert( 0 == '' ); // true\n\n\n其他比较也将转换为数字。\n严格相等运算符 === 不会进行转换：不同的类型总是指不同的值。\n值 null 和 undefined 是特殊的：它们只在 == 下相等，且不相等于其他任何值。\n大于/小于比较，在比较字符串时，会按照字符顺序逐个字符地进行比较。其他类型则被转换为数字。\n\n其他运算符\n\n还有很少一部分其他运算符，如逗号运算符。\n\n循环\n\n我们涵盖了 3 种类型的循环：\n\n// 1\nwhile (condition) {\n  ...\n}\n\n// 2\ndo {\n  ...\n} while (condition);\n\n// 3\nfor(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n在 for(let...) 循环内部声明的变量，只在该循环内可见。但我们也可以省略 let 并重用已有的变量。指令 break/continue 允许退出整个循环/当前迭代。使用标签来打破嵌套循环。\n\n“switch” 结构\n\n“switch” 结构可以替代多个 if 检查。它内部使用 ===（严格相等）进行比较。\n例如：\n\nlet age = prompt('Your age?', 18);\n\nswitch (age) {\n  case 18:\n    alert(\"Won't work\"); // prompt 的结果是一个字符串，而不是数字\n    break;\n\n  case \"18\":\n    alert(\"This works!\");\n    break;\n\n  default:\n    alert(\"Any value not equal to one above\");\n}\n\n\n函数\n\n函数表达式 vs 函数声明\n\n函数声明：在主代码流中声明为单独的语句的函数：\n\n// 函数声明\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n\n\n函数表达式：在一个表达式中或另一个语法结构中创建的函数。下面这个函数是在赋值表达式 = 右侧创建的：\n\n// 函数表达式\nlet sum = function(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n};\n\n\n更细微的差别是，JavaScript 引擎会在 什么时候 创建函数。\n函数表达式是在代码执行到达时被创建，并且仅从那一刻起可用。\n一旦代码执行到赋值表达式 let sum = function… 的右侧，此时就会开始创建该函数，并且可以从现在开始使用（分配，调用等）。\n\n函数声明则不同。\n在函数声明被定义之前，它就可以被调用。\n例如，一个全局函数声明对整个脚本来说都是可见的，无论它被写在这个脚本的哪个位置。\n这是内部算法的缘故。当 JavaScript 准备 运行脚本时，首先会在脚本中寻找全局函数声明，并创建这些函数。我们可以将其视为“初始化阶段”。\n在处理完所有函数声明后，代码才被执行。所以运行时能够使用这些函数。\n\n例如下面的代码会正常工作：\n\nsayHi(\"John\"); // Hello, John\n\nfunction sayHi(name) {\n  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );\n}\n\n\n函数声明 sayHi 是在 JavaScript 准备运行脚本时被创建的，在这个脚本的任何位置都可见。\n\n……如果它是一个函数表达式，它就不会工作：\n\nsayHi(\"John\"); // error!\n\nlet sayHi = function(name) {  // (*) no magic any more\n  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );\n};\n\n\n函数表达式在代码执行到它时才会被创建。只会发生在 (*) 行。为时已晚。\n\n函数声明的另外一个特殊的功能是它们的块级作用域。\n严格模式下，当一个函数声明在一个代码块内时，它在该代码块内的任何位置都是可见的。但在代码块外不可见。\n例如，想象一下我们需要依赖于在代码运行过程中获得的变量 age 声明一个函数 welcome()。并且我们计划在之后的某个时间使用它。\n如果我们使用函数声明，则以下代码无法像预期那样工作：\n\nlet age = prompt(\"What is your age?\", 18);\n\n// 有条件地声明一个函数\nif (age < 18) {\n\n  function welcome() {\n    alert(\"Hello!\");\n  }\n\n} else {\n\n  function welcome() {\n    alert(\"Greetings!\");\n  }\n\n}\n\n// ……稍后使用\nwelcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined\n\n\n这是因为函数声明只在它所在的代码块中可见。\n下面是另一个例子：\n\nlet age = 16; // 拿 16 作为例子\n\nif (age < 18) {\n  welcome();               // \\   (运行)\n                           //  |\n  function welcome() {     //  |\n    alert(\"Hello!\");       //  |  函数声明在声明它的代码块内任意位置都可用\n  }                        //  |\n                           //  |\n  welcome();               // /   (运行)\n\n} else {\n\n  function welcome() {\n    alert(\"Greetings!\");\n  }\n}\n\n// 在这里，我们在花括号外部调用函数，我们看不到它们内部的函数声明。\n\n\nwelcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined\n\n\n我们怎么才能让 welcome 在 if 外可见呢？\n正确的做法是使用函数表达式，并将 welcome 赋值给在 if 外声明的变量，并具有正确的可见性。\n下面的代码可以如愿运行：\n\nlet age = prompt(\"What is your age?\", 18);\n\nlet welcome;\n\nif (age < 18) {\n\n  welcome = function() {\n    alert(\"Hello!\");\n  };\n\n} else {\n\n  welcome = function() {\n    alert(\"Greetings!\");\n  };\n\n}\n\nwelcome(); // 现在可以了\n\n\n或者我们可以使用问号运算符 ? 来进一步对代码进行简化：\n\nlet age = prompt(\"What is your age?\", 18);\n\nlet welcome = (age < 18) ?\n  function() { alert(\"Hello!\"); } :\n  function() { alert(\"Greetings!\"); };\n\nwelcome(); // 现在可以了\n\n\n什么时候选择函数声明与函数表达式？\n\n根据经验，当我们需要声明一个函数时，首先考虑函数声明语法。它能够为组织代码提供更多的灵活性。因为我们可以在声明这些函数之前调用这些函数。\n这对代码可读性也更好，因为在代码中查找 function f(…) {…} 比 let f = function(…) {…} 更容易。函数声明更“醒目”。\n……但是，如果由于某种原因而导致函数声明不适合我们（我们刚刚看过上面的例子），那么应该使用函数表达式。\n\n箭头函数\n\n创建函数还有另外一种非常简单的语法，并且这种方法通常比函数表达式更好。\n它被称为“箭头函数”，因为它看起来像这样：\n\nlet func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;\n\n\n这里创建了一个函数 func，它接受参数 arg1..argN，然后使用参数对右侧的 expression 求值并返回其结果。\n换句话说，它是下面这段代码的更短的版本：\n\nlet func = function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) {\n    return expression;\n};\n\n\n让我们来看一个具体的例子：\n\nlet sum = (a, b) => a + b;\n\n/* 这个箭头函数是下面这个函数的更短的版本：\n\nlet sum = function(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n};\n*/\n\nalert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3\n\n\n可以看到 (a, b) => a + b 表示一个函数接受两个名为 a 和 b 的参数。在执行时，它将对表达式 a + b 求值，并返回计算结果。\n\n如果我们只有一个参数，还可以省略掉参数外的圆括号，使代码更短。例如：\n\nlet double = n => n * 2;// 差不多等同于：let double = function(n) { return n * 2 }\n\nalert( double(3) ); // 6\n\n\n如果没有参数，括号则是空的（但括号必须保留）：\n\nlet sayHi = () => alert(\"Hello!\");\nsayHi();\n\n\n箭头函数可以像函数表达式一样使用。\n例如，动态创建一个函数：\n\nlet age = prompt(\"What is your age?\", 18);\n\nlet welcome = (age < 18) ?\n  () => alert('Hello!') :\n  () => alert(\"Greetings!\");\n\nwelcome();\n\n\n一开始，箭头函数可能看起来并不熟悉，也不容易读懂，但一旦我们看习惯了之后，这种情况很快就会改变。\n箭头函数对于简单的单行行为（action）来说非常方便，尤其是当我们懒得打太多字的时候。\n\n多行的箭头函数\n\n到目前为止，我们看到的箭头函数非常简单。它们从 => 的左侧获取参数，计算并返回右侧表达式的计算结果。\n有时我们需要更复杂一点的函数，比如带有多行的表达式或语句。在这种情况下，我们可以使用花括号将它们括起来。主要区别在于，用花括号括起来之后，需要包含 return 才能返回值（就像常规函数一样）。\n就像这样：\n\nlet sum = (a, b) => {  // 花括号表示开始一个多行函数\n  let result = a + b;\n  return result; // 如果我们使用了花括号，那么我们需要一个显式的 “return”\n};\n\nalert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3\n\n\n作用域\n\n// 全局作用域\nlet globalVar = \"我是全局变量\";\n\nfunction test() {\n  // 函数作用域\n  let localVar = \"我是局部变量\";\n  console.log(globalVar);  // ✅ 可以访问\n  console.log(localVar);   // ✅ 可以访问\n}\n\ntest();\nconsole.log(globalVar);  // ✅ 可以访问\n// console.log(localVar);  // ❌ 报错！\n\n// 块级作用域\nif (true) {\n  let blockVar = \"块级变量\";\n  console.log(blockVar);  // ✅\n}\n// console.log(blockVar);  // ❌ 报错！\n\n\n对象\n\n什么是对象？\n\n对象是键值对的集合，用于存储和组织相关的数据和功能。\n\n// 创建对象的几种方式\n\n//1. 对象字面量（最常用）\nconst person = {\n  name: \"张三\",\n  age: 25,\n  city: \"北京\"\n};\n\n// 2. 使用 new Object()\nconst car = new Object();\ncar.brand = \"Tesla\";\ncar.model = \"Model 3\";\n\n// 3. 使用构造函数\nfunction Person(name, age) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\nconst user = new Person(\"李四\", 30);\n\n// 4. 使用 Object.create()\nconst proto = { greeting: \"Hello\" };\nconst obj = Object.create(proto);\n\n\n访问对象属性\n\nconst student = {\n  name: \"小明\",\n  age: 18,\n  \"favorite color\": \"blue\"  // 带空格的属性名\n};\n\n// 点表示法\nconsole.log(student.name);  // \"小明\"\n\n// 方括号表示法\nconsole.log(student[\"age\"]);  // 18\nconsole.log(student[\"favorite color\"]);  // \"blue\"\n\n// 动态访问\nconst key = \"name\";\nconsole.log(student[key]);  // \"小明\"\n\n\n对象的常用操作\n\nconst book = {\n  title: \"JavaScript 权威指南\",\n  author: \"David Flanagan\",\n  year: 2020\n};\n\n// 添加/修改属性\nbook.pages = 1096;\nbook.year = 2021;\n\n// 删除属性\ndelete book.year;\n\n// 检查属性是否存在\nconsole.log(\"title\" in book);  // true\nconsole.log(book.hasOwnProperty(\"author\"));  // true\n\n// 遍历对象\nfor (let key in book) {\n  console.log(`${key}: ${book[key]}`);\n}\n\n// 获取所有键\nconsole.log(Object.keys(book));  // [\"title\", \"author\", \"pages\"]\n\n// 获取所有值\nconsole.log(Object.values(book));  // [\"JavaScript 权威指南\", \"David Flanagan\", 1096]\n\n// 获取键值对数组\nconsole.log(Object.entries(book));  \n// [[\"title\", \"JavaScript 权威指南\"], [\"author\", \"David Flanagan\"], [\"pages\", 1096]\n\n\n类\n\n基本语法\n\nclass MyClass {\n  // class 方法\n  constructor() { ... }\n  method1() { ... }\n  method2() { ... }\n  method3() { ... }\n  ...\n}\n\n\n然后使用 new MyClass() 来创建具有上述列出的所有方法的新对象。\nnew 会自动调用 constructor() 方法，因此我们可以在 constructor() 中初始化对象。\n例如：\n\nclass User {\n\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(this.name);\n  }\n\n}\n\n// 用法：\nlet user = new User(\"John\");\nuser.sayHi();\n\n\n当 new User(\"John\") 被调用：\n\n一个新对象被创建。constructor 使用给定的参数运行，并将其赋值给 this.name。\n……然后我们就可以调用对象方法了，例如 user.sayHi。\n\n什么是 class\n\nclass User {\n  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }\n  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }\n}\n\n// class 是一个函数\nalert(typeof User); // function\n\n// ...或者，更确切地说，是 constructor 方法\nalert(User === User.prototype.constructor); // true\n\n// 方法在 User.prototype 中，例如：\nalert(User.prototype.sayHi); // sayHi 方法的代码\n\n// 在原型中实际上有两个方法\nalert(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(User.prototype)); // constructor, sayHi\n\n\nclass User {...} 构造实际上做了如下的事儿：\n\n创建一个名为 User 的函数，该函数成为类声明的结果。该函数的代码来自于 constructor 方法（如果我们不编写这种方法，那么它就被假定为空）。存储类中的方法，例如 User.prototype 中的 sayHi。\n\n类表达式\n\n// “命名类表达式（Named Class Expression）”\n// (规范中没有这样的术语，但是它和命名函数表达式类似)\nlet User = class MyClass {\n  sayHi() {\n    alert(MyClass); // MyClass 这个名字仅在类内部可见\n  }\n};\n\nnew User().sayHi(); // 正常运行，显示 MyClass 中定义的内容\n\nalert(MyClass); // error，MyClass 在外部不可见\n\n\ngetter 和 setter\n\nclass User {\n\n  constructor(name) {\n    // 调用 setter\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  get name() {\n    return this._name;\n  }\n\n  set name(value) {\n    if (value.length < 4) {\n      alert(\"Name is too short.\");\n      return;\n    }\n    this._name = value;\n  }\n\n}\n\nlet user = new User(\"John\");\nalert(user.name); // John\n\nuser = new User(\"\"); // Name is too short.\n\n\n类声明可以通过在 User.prototype 中创建 getters 和 setters 来实现。\n\n面向对象\n\n简单类比\n\n// 把\"人\"这个概念变成代码中的对象\n\nclass Person {\n  constructor(name, age) {\n    this.name = name;  // 属性：名字\n    this.age = age;    // 属性：年龄\n  }\n  \n  // 方法：说话\n  speak(message) {\n    console.log(`${this.name} 说: ${message}`);\n  }\n  \n  // 方法：自我介绍\n  introduce() {\n    console.log(`大家好，我是 ${this.name}，今年 ${this.age} 岁`);\n  }\n}\n\n// 创建具体的人（对象）\nconst xm = new Person('xm', 20);\nxm.introduce();  // 大家好，我是 xm，今年 20 岁\nxm.speak('你好！'); // xm 说: 你好！\n\n\n核心概念\n\n封装\n\n把数据和方法包在一起，隐藏细节\n\nclass Phone {\n  #battery = 100;  // 私有属性，外部看不到\n  \n  useBattery() {\n    this.#battery -= 10;\n    console.log(`剩余电量: ${this.#battery}%`);\n  }\n}\n\nconst myPhone = new Phone();\nmyPhone.useBattery();

   // 添加到末尾\ncontainer.prepend('开头的文本', p);    // 添加到开头\n\n// after / before - 在元素前后插入\ndiv.before('前面的内容');\ndiv.after('后面的内容');\n\n// insertAdjacentHTML - 插入 HTML 字符串\ncontainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin', '<p>在元素前</p>');\ncontainer.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', '<p>在内容开头</p>');\ncontainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', '<p>在内容末尾</p>');\ncontainer.insertAdjacentHTML('afterend', '<p>在元素后</p>');\n\n// 4. 完整示例：创建一个列表\nconst ul = document.createElement('ul');\nconst items = ['苹果', '香蕉', '橙子'];\n\nitems.forEach(item => {\n  const li = document.createElement('li');\n  li.textContent = item;\n  ul.appendChild(li);\n});\n\ndocument.body.appendChild(ul);\n\n\n删除和替换元素\n\nconst element = document.querySelector('#myElement');\nconst parent = document.querySelector('#parent');\n\n// 1. 删除元素\nelement.remove();  // 直接删除自己（现代方法）\nparent.removeChild(element);  // 通过父元素删除（老方法）\n\n// 2. 替换元素\nconst newElement = document.createElement('div');\nnewElement.textContent = '新元素';\nelement.replaceWith(newElement);  // 直接替换（现代方法）\nparent.replaceChild(newElement, element);  // 通过父元素替换（老方法）\n\n// 3. 清空元素内容\nparent.innerHTML = '';  // 方法 1\nwhile (parent.firstChild) {  // 方法 2（更安全）\n  parent.removeChild(parent.firstChild);\n}\n\n\nBOM（浏览器对象模型）\n\n用于与浏览器窗口交互\n\n// 窗口对象\nwindow.alert('提示')\nwindow.confirm('确认?')\nwindow.location.href = 'https://example.com'\n\n// 定时器\nsetTimeout(() => { console.log('延迟执行') }, 1000)\nsetInterval(() => { console.log('循环执行') }, 1000)\n\n// 浏览器历史\nwindow.history.back()\nwindow.history.forward()\n\n\n事件\n\n处理用户交互事件\n\nconst button = document.querySelector('#myButton');\n\n// 1. addEventListener（推荐）\nbutton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n  console.log('按钮被点击了');\n  console.log('事件对象：', event);\n});\n\n// 2. 使用箭头函数\nbutton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {\n  console.log('点击', event.target);\n});\n\n// 3. 命名函数（便于移除）\nfunction handleClick(event) {\n  console.log('处理点击');\n}\nbutton.addEventListener('click', handleClick);\n\n// 移除事件监听器\nbutton.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);\n\n// 4. 老方法（不推荐，会覆盖之前的）\nbutton.onclick = function() {\n  console.log('点击');\n};\n\n// 5.
